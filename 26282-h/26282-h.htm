<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>It is a difficult task to go back to ages by-gone,
to divest ourselves of what we know and are and
form a clear conception of generations that have
been, of their experiences, objects, modes of life,
thought and expression. It is a task better suited
to the novelist than the historian, and even the
former treads on dangerous ground in attempting
it. One of the prime objects of the Columbian
Historical Novels is to give the reader as clear an
idea as possible of the common people, as well as
of the rulers of the age. The author has endeavored
at the risk of criticism to clothe the
speeches of his characters in the dialect and idioms
peculiar to the age in which they lived. In the
former volumes, sentences most criticised are those
taken literally as spoken or written at the time.
Though it would seem that a few critics grow more
severe the nearer an author approaches the truth,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>yet the greater number of thinking men and women
who review these books are students themselves,
and the author who adheres to the language of a by-gone
age has nothing to fear from them.</p>

<p>The "Witch of Salem" is designed to cover
twenty years in the history of the United States,
or from the year 1680 to 1700, including all the
principal features of this period. Charles Stevens
of Salem, with Cora Waters, the daughter of an
indented slave, whose father was captured at the
time of the overthrow of the Duke of Monmouth,
are the principal characters. Samuel Parris, the
chief actor in the Salem tragedy, is a serious
study, and has been painted, after a careful research,
according to the conception formed of him.
No greater villain ever lived in any age. He had
scarce a redeeming feature. His religion was hypocrisy,
superstition, revenge and bigotry. His
ambition led him to deeds of atrocity unsurpassed.
Having drawn the information on which this story
is founded from what seem the most reliable
sources, and woven the story in a way which it is
hoped will be pleasing and instructive, we send
this volume forth to speak for itself.</p>

<p>The autumnal evening was
cool, dark and gusty.
Storm-clouds were gathering
thickly overhead, and
the ground beneath was covered
with rustling leaves,
which, blighted by the early
frosts, lay helpless and dead
at the roadside, or were
made the sport of the wind. A
solitary horseman was slowly
plodding along the road but a
few miles from the village of
Salem. In truth he was so near to the famous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Puritan village, that, through the hills and intervening
tree-tops, he could have seen the spires of
the churches had he raised his melancholy eyes
from the ground. The rider was not a youth, nor
had he reached middle age. His face was handsome,
though distorted with agony. Occasionally
he pressed his hand to his side as if in pain;
but maugre pain, weariness, or anguish, he pressed
on, admonished by the lengthening shadows of
the approach of night. Turning his great, sad,
brown eyes at last to where the road wound
about the valley across which the distant spires of
Salem could be seen, he sighed:</p>

<p>"Can I reach it to-night? I must!"</p>

<p>Salem, that strange village to which the horseman
was wending his way, in October, 1684, was a
different village from the Salem of to-day. It is a
town familiar to every American student, and,
having derived its fame more from its historic recollections
than from its commerce or industries, its
name carries us back two centuries, suggesting the
faint and transient image of the life of the Pilgrim
Fathers, who gave that sacred name to the place of
their chosen habitation. Whatever changes civilization
or time may bring about, the features of
natural scenery are, for the most part, unalterable.
Massachusetts Bay is as it was when the Pilgrim
Fathers first beheld it. On land, there are still the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
craggy hills, with jutting promontories of granite,
where the barberries grow, and room is found in the
narrow valleys for small farms, and for apple trees,
and little slopes of grass, and patches of tillage
where all else looks barren.</p>

<p>The scenery is not more picturesque to-day, than
on that chill autumnal eve, when the strange horseman
was urging his jaded steed along the path
which led to the village. His garments were travel-stained
and his features haggard.</p>

<p>Three hunters with guns on their shoulders were
not half a mile in advance of the horseman. They,
too, evidently had passed a day of arduous toil;
for climbing New England hills in search of the
wild deer was no easy task.</p>

<p>They were men who had hardly reached middle
age; but their grave Puritanic demeanor made them
look older than they were. Their conversation was
grave, gloomy and mysterious. There was little
light or frivolous about them, for to them life was
sombre. The hunt was not sport, but arduous toil,
and their legs were so weary they could scarcely drag
themselves along.</p>

<p>"Now we may rejoice, John Bly, that home is
within sight, for truly I am tired, and I think I
could not go much farther," one of the pedestrians
remarked to the man at his side.</p>

<p>"Right glad will I be when we are near!" answered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the fatigued John Bly. "This has been a
hard day with fruitless result."</p>

<p>"We have had some fair shots to-day," put in a
third man, who walked a little behind the others.</p>

<p>"Verily, we have; yet what profits it to us,
Samuel Gray, when our guns fail to carry the ball
to the place? I had as many fair shots to-day as
would bring down a dozen bucks, and yet I missed
every time. You know full well I am not one to
miss."</p>

<p>"You are not, John Louder."</p>

<p>Then the three men looked mysteriously at each
other. They were all believers in supernatural
agencies, and the fact that such a faultless marksman
should miss was enough to establish in their
minds a belief that other than natural causes were
at work. There could be no other reason given
that John Louder should miss his mark, than that
his gun was "bewitched." It was an age when
the last dying throes of superstition seemed fastening
on the people's minds, and the spasmodic struggle
threatened to upset their reason. The New
Englander's mind was prepared for mysteries as the
fallow ground is prepared for the seed. He was
busied conquering the rugged earth and making it
yield to his husbandry. His time was divided between
arduous toil for bread and fighting the Indians.
He was hemmed in by a gloomy old forest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the magnitude of which he did not dream, and it
was only natural, with his fertile imagination, narrow
perceptions and limited knowledge, that he
would see strange sights and hear strange sounds.
Images and visions which have been portrayed in
tales of romance and given interest to the pages of
poetry were made by him to throng the woods, flit
through the air and hover over the heads of terrified
officials, whose learning should have placed
them beyond the bounds of superstition. The
ghosts of murdered wives, husbands and children
played their part with a vividness of representation
and artistic skill of expression hardly surpassed in
scenic representation on the stage. The superstition
of the Middle Ages was embodied in real action,
with all its extravagant absurdities and monstrosities.
This, carried into the courts of law, where
the relations of society and conduct or feelings of
individuals were suffered to be under control of
fanciful or mystical notions, could have but one
effect. When a whole people abandoned the solid
ground of common sense, overleaped the boundaries
of human knowledge, gave itself up to wild
reveries, and let loose its passions without restraint,
the result was more destructive to society than a
Vesuvius to Pompeii. When John Louder said
his gun was bewitched, there was no incredulous
smile on his companions' faces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>The political complexion of New England at
that time no doubt had much to do with the superstitious
awe which overspread that country. Within
the recollection of many inhabitants, the parent
government had changed three times. Charles II.
had lived such a life of furious dissipation, that
his earthly career was drawing to a close.</p>

<p>The New England people were zealous theologians,
and Massachusetts and Plymouth hated
above all sects the Roman Catholics. Charles II.
could not reign long, and James, Duke of York,
his brother, would be his successor, as it was generally
known that Charles II. had no legitimate
heir. It was hoped by some that his illegitimate
son, the Duke of Monmouth, a Protestant, might
succeed him. Some had even hinted that Charles
II., while flying from Cromwell, had secretly married
Lucy Waters, the mother of the duke; but
this has never been proved in history.</p>

<p>The somewhat ostentatious manner in which the
Duke of York had been accustomed to go to mass,
during the life of his brother, was the chief cause
of the general dislike in which he was held. Even
Charles, giddy and careless as he was in general,
saw the imprudence of James' conduct, and significantly
told him on one occasion that <i>he</i> had no desire
to go upon his travels again, whatever James
might wish. When it became currently reported<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
all over the American colonies that this bigoted
Catholic would, on the death of his brother, become
their ruler, the New Englanders began to tremble
for their religion. There was murmuring from
every village and plantation, keeping society in a
constant ferment.</p>

<p>The three hunters were still discussing their ill
luck when the sound of horse's hoofs fell on their
ears, and they turned slowly about to see a stranger
approaching them on horseback. His sad, gray
eye had something wild and supernatural about it.
His costume had at one time been elegant, but was
now stained with dust and travel. It included a
wrought flowing neckcloth, a sash covered with a
silver-laced red cloth coat, a satin waistcoat embroidered
with gold, a trooping scarf and a silver
hat-band. His trousers, which were met above
the knees by a pair of riding boots, like the remainder
of his attire, was covered with dust.</p>

<p>The expression of pain on his face was misconstrued
by the superstitious hunters into a look of
fiendish triumph, and John Louder, seizing the arm
of Bly, whispered:</p>

<p>"It is he!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know it, Bly, for he hath followed me all day."</p>

<p>"Then wherefore not give him the ball, which
he hath guarded from the deer?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would be of no avail, John. A witch cannot
be killed with lead. He would throw the ball
in my face and laugh at me."</p>

<p>The three walked hastily along, casting wary and
uneasy glances behind as the horseman drew nearer.
Each trembled lest the horseman should speak, and
once or twice he seemed as if he would; but pain,
or some other cause unknown to the hunters, prevented
his doing so. He rode swiftly by, disappearing
over the hill in the direction of Salem.</p>

<p>When he was out of sight the three hunters
paused, and, falling on their knees, each uttered a
short prayer for deliverance from Satan. As they
rose, John Louder said:</p>

<p>"Now I know full well, good men, that he is
the wizard who hath tampered with my gun."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Ah! well may you ask, Samuel Gray, who he
is; a stranger, the black man, the devil, who hath
assumed this form to mislead and torment us.
One can only wonder at the various cunning of
Satan," and Louder sighed.</p>

<p>"Truly you speak, friend John," Bly answered.
"The enemy of men's souls is constantly on the
lookout for the unwary."</p>

<p>"I have met him and wrestled with him, until I
was almost overcome; but, having on the whole
armor of God, I did cry out 'Get thee behind me,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Satan!' and, behold, I could smell the sulphur of
hell, as the gates were opened to admit the prince
of darkness."</p>

<p>The shades of night were creeping over the earth,
and the three weary hunters were not yet within
sight of their homes, when the horseman who had
so strangely excited their fears drew rein at a spring
not a fourth of a mile from the village of Salem
and allowed his horse to drink. He pressed his
hand to his side, as if suffering intolerable anguish,
and murmured:</p>

<p>"Will I find shelter there?"</p>

<p>Overcome by suffering, he at last slipped from
his saddle and, sitting among the rustling leaves
heedless of the lowering clouds and threatened
storm, buried his face in his hands. Two hours
had certainly elapsed since he first came in sight of
Salem, and yet so slow had been his pace, that he
had not reached the village; but on the earth,
threatened with a raging tempest, he breathed in
feeble accents a prayer to God for strength to perform
the great and holy task on which he was bent.
He was sick and feeble. In his side was a wound
that might prove fatal, and to this he occasionally
pressed his hand as if in pain.</p>

<p>He who heareth the poor when they cry unto
Him, answered the prayer of the desolate. A
farmer boy came along whistling merrily despite the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
approaching night and storm. Not the chilling
blasts of October, the dread of darkness, nor the
cold world could depress the spirits of Charles
Stevens, the merry lad of Salem. In fact, he was
so merry that, by the straight-laced Puritans, he
was thought ungodly. He had a predisposition to
whistling and singing, and was of "a light and
frivolous carriage." He laughed at the sanctity
of some people, and was known to smile even on
the Lord's Day. When, in the exuberance of his
spirits, his feet kept time to his whistling, the good
Salemites were horrified by the ungodly dance.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens, however, had a better heart,
and was a truer Christian than many of those sanctimonious
critics, who sought to restrain the joy
and gladness with which God filled his soul. It
was this good Samaritan who came upon the suffering
stranger whom the three Puritans had condemned
in their own minds as an emissary of the
devil.</p>

<p>"Why do you sit here, sir?" Charles asked,
leaving off his whistle. "Night is coming on, and
it is growing so chill and cold, you must keep moving,
or surely you will perish."</p>

<p>"I cannot rise," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Cannot rise! prythee, what ails you, friend?"</p>

<p>"I am sick, sore and wounded."</p>

<p>"Wounded!" cried Charles, "and sick, too!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 567px;">
<img src="images/prythee.jpg" width="567" height="584" alt="&quot;Cannot rise! Prythee, what ails you, friend?&quot;" title="&quot;Cannot rise! Prythee, what ails you, friend?&quot;" />
</div>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">"Cannot rise! Prythee, what ails you, friend?"</span></p>

<p>His sharp young eyes were enabled to penetrate
the deepening shades of twilight, and he saw a
ghastly pallor overspreading the man's face, who,
pressing his hand upon his side, gave vent to gasps
of keen agony. His left side was stained with
blood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are wounded!" Charles Stevens at last
declared. "Pray, how came it about?"</p>

<p>"I was fired upon by an unseen foe, for what
cause I know not, as, being a stranger in these
parts, I have had no quarrel."</p>

<p>"Come, let me help you to rise."</p>

<p>"No, it is useless. I am tired and too faint to
go further. Let me lie here. I will soon be dead,
and all this agony will be over."</p>

<p>At this, the cheerful mind of Charles Stevens
asserted itself by inspiring hope in the heart of the
fainting stranger.</p>

<p>"No, no, my friend, never give up. Don't say
die, so long as you live. It is but a few rods
further to the home where I live with my mother.
I can help you walk so far, and there you can
get rested and warmed, and mother will dress your
wound."</p>

<p>"Can I go?" the traveller asked.</p>

<p>"Men can do wonders when they try."</p>

<p>"Then I will try."</p>

<p>"I will help you."</p>

<p>The boy threw his strong arm around the man
and raised him to his feet; but his limbs no longer
obeyed his will, and he sank again upon the ground.</p>

<p>"It is of no avail, my good boy. I cannot go.
Leave me to die."</p>

<p>Charles turned his eyes about to look for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
stranger's horse; but it had strayed off in the darkness.
To search for him would be useless, and for
a moment the good Samaritan stood as if in thought;
then, stripping off his coat and wrapping it around
the wounded man, he said hopefully:</p>

<p>"I will be back soon, don't move," and he hurried
away swiftly toward home. On reaching the
threshold, he thanked God that he was not a wanderer
on such a night.</p>

<p>The New England kitchen, with its pewter-filled
dresser, reflecting and multiplying the genial blaze
of the log-heaped fire-place, its high-backed, rush-bottomed
chairs, grating as they were moved over
the neatly sanded floor, its massive beam running
midway of the ceiling across the room, and its many
doors, leading to other rooms and attics, was a
picture of comfort two hundred years ago. The
widowed mother, with her honest, beautiful face
surrounded by a neat, dark cap border, met her son
as he entered the kitchen and, glancing at him
proudly, said:</p>

<p>"The wind gives you good color, Charles."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother," rubbing his cheeks, "they do
burn some;&mdash;mother."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I heard you tell Mr. Bly, the other day, that
you could trust me with all you had. Will you
trust me with old Moll and the cart to-night?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you want with Moll and the cart?"</p>

<p>"To go to the big spring under the hill for a poor
man who is sick and wounded."</p>

<p>"And alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother."</p>

<p>"It is a freezing night."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, and he may die. He is unable to
walk. Remember the story of the good Samaritan."</p>

<p>After a long pause, the widow said, "Yes, you
may have old Moll and the cart. Bring him here,
and we will care for him; but remember that to-morrow's
work must be done."</p>

<p>"If you have any fault to find to-morrow night,
don't trust me again!" and the boy, turning to the
cupboard beneath the dressers, buttered a generous
slice of bread, then left the room with a small
pitcher, and returned with it brimming full of cider,
his mother closely noting all, while she busied herself
making things to rights in her culinary department.
Charles next went out and harnessed the
mare to the cart, then returned to the kitchen for
his bread and cider.</p>

<p>"Why not eat that before you go?" queried
the mother.</p>

<p>"I am not hungry, I have had some supper,
you know. Good night, mother. I will be back
soon; so have the bed ready for the wounded
stranger."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"God bless you, my brave boy," the mother exclaimed,
as he went out and sprang into the cart.
She now knew that he had taken the bread and
cider for the sick man, under the hill.</p>

<p>Charles hurried old Moll to a faster gait than she
was accustomed to go, and found the stranger where
he had left him. Leaping from the cart, he said:</p>

<p>"I am back, sir! You said you were faint.
Here's some of our cider, and if you will sit up
and drink it and eat this bread, you will feel better,
and here is old Moll and the cart ready to take you
home where you will receive good Christian treatment
until you are well enough to go on your way
rejoicing."</p>

<p>So he went on, bobbing now here and now there
and talking as fast as he could, so as not to hear
the poor man's outpourings of gratitude, as he ate
and drank and was refreshed. With some difficulty,
he got the stranger into the cart, where, supported
by the boy's strong arm, he rode in almost
total silence through the increasing darkness to the
home of the widow Stevens. He was taken from
the cart and was soon reclining upon a bed.</p>

<p>His wound, though painful, was not dangerous
and began to heal almost immediately. Surgery
was in its infancy in America, and on the frontier
of the American colonies, every one was his own
surgeon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>The widow dressed the wound herself, and the
stranger recovered rapidly. Charles next day found
a horse straying in the forest with a saddle and holsters,
and, knowing it to be the steed of the wounded
stranger, he brought it home.</p>

<p>As the wounded man recovered he became more
silent and melancholy. He had not even spoken
his name and seldom uttered a word unless addressed.</p>

<p>One night this mysterious stranger disappeared
from the widow's cottage. He might have been
thought ungrateful had he not left behind five
golden guineas, which, the note left behind said,
were in part to remunerate the good people who had
watched over and cared for him so kindly. Charles
Stevens and his mother were much puzzled at this
mysterious stranger, and often when alone they commented
on his conduct.</p>

<p>Their home was outside the village of Salem, and
for days they did not have a visitor; but two or
three of their neighbors had seen the stranger while
at their house, yet they told no one about him.
His mysterious disappearance was kept a secret by
mother and son. Little did they dream that in
after years they would suffer untold sorrow for
playing the part of good Samaritans.</p>

<p>John Louder and his friends had almost forgotten
their day of hard luck in the woods. Their more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
recent hunts had proven successful, for the witches
had temporarily left off tampering with their guns.
The stranger whom they had met on that evening
was quite forgotten.</p>

<p>A fortnight after the stranger disappeared, John
Louder was wandering in the forest, his gun on his
shoulder. The sun had just dipped below the
western hills and trees, and he was approaching a
small lake at which the deer came to drink.</p>

<p>It was a dense forest through which he was pressing
his way. In places it was so dense he was compelled
to part the underbrush with his hands.
Centuries of summer suns had warmed the tops of
the same noble oaks and pines, sending their heat
even to the roots. Though the early frosts of October
had stricken many a leaf from its parent stem,
enough still remained to obscure the vision at a
rod's distance.</p>

<p>Night was approaching, and John Louder, brave
as he was to natural danger, had a strange dread of
shadows and the unreal.</p>

<p>He pressed his way through the wood, until a
spot almost clear of timber was in sight. This
little area, which afforded a good view of the sky,
although it was pretty well filled with dead trees,
lay between two of those high hills or low mountains
into which the whole surface of the adjacent
country was broken.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Dashing aside the bushes and brambles of the
swamp, the forester burst into the area with an exclamation
of delight.</p>

<p>"One can breathe here! There is the lake to
which the deer come to drink. Now, if Satan
send not a witch to lead my bullets astray, perchance
I may have a venison ere an hour has
passed."</p>

<p>He gathered some dry sticks of wood and, with
his flint and steel, quickly kindled a fire.</p>

<p>His fire was to keep off the mosquitoes, which
were tormenting in that locality. The fire did not
alarm the deer, for they had seen the woods burn
so often that they would go quite close to a blaze.</p>

<p>Hardly had he lighted his fire, when he was
startled by the tramp of feet near, and a moment
later a horseman rode out of the woods and drew
rein before him.</p>

<p>Louder was surprised, but by no means alarmed.
A man in the forest was by no means uncommon,
yet he felt a little curious to know why he was
there. He reasoned that probably the fellow had
lost his way, and had been attracted by his camp
fire; but the stranger's question dispelled that delusion.</p>

<p>"Are you John Louder?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You live at Salem?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Are you a Protestant?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"You do not believe in the transubstantiation
of the body and blood of Christ into the bread and
wine of the Sacrament?"</p>

<p>John Louder, who was a true Puritan and a hater
of the Papists, quickly responded:</p>

<p>"I do not hold to any such theology."</p>

<p>"Nor do you believe in the infallibility of the
pope?"</p>

<p>"I believe no such doctrine."</p>

<p>"Then there can be no doubt that you are a true
Protestant."</p>

<p>"I am," Louder answered with no small degree
of pride.</p>

<p>"So much the better."</p>

<p>The stranger dismounted from his horse and
slipped his left hand through the rein, allowing the
tired beast to graze, while with his right hand he
began searching in his pockets for something.</p>

<p>"Would you have a Catholic king?" he asked
while searching his pockets.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You prefer a Protestant."</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"I knew it," and he continued, "King Charles
is nearing his end. But a few months more must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
see the last of this monarch, and then we will have
another. The great question which appeals to the
heart of every Englishman to-day is, shall it be a
Protestant or a Catholic?"</p>

<p>"A Protestant!" cried John Louder, in his
bigoted enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Then, John Louder, it behooves the English
people to speak their minds at once, lest they have
fastened upon them a monarch who will wrench from
them their religious liberties."</p>

<p>Louder was wondering what the man could mean
when the stranger suddenly took from his pocket a
book. It was a book with a red back, as could be
seen from the fire-light. The stranger drew from
another pocket a pen and an ink horn and, in a
voice which was solemn and impressive, said:</p>

<p>"Sign!"</p>

<p>John Louder was astonished at the request, or
command, whichever it might be, and mechanically
stretched out his hand to take the book. At this
moment the camp-fire suddenly flamed up, and he
afterward averred that the face of the stranger was
suddenly changed to that of a devil, and from his
burning orbs there issued blue jets of flame, while
the whole air was permeated with sulphur. With
a yell of horror, he started back, crying:</p>

<p>"Take it away! take away your book! I will not
sign! I will not sign!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sign it, and I promise you a Protestant king."</p>

<p>"Away! begone! The whole armor of God be
between me and you."</p>

<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Seizing a firebrand, he searched for the print of a cloven hoof.</span></p>

<p>Quaking with superstitious dread, Louder sank
down upon the ground and buried his face in his
hands. For several minutes he remained thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
trembling with fear, and when he finally recovered
sufficiently to raise his eyes, the stranger was gone.</p>

<p>He and his horse had vanished, and John
Louder, seizing a firebrand, searched the ground
for the print of a cloven foot. He found it and,
snatching up his rifle, ran home as rapidly as he
could. It was late that night when he reached
his house and, rapping on the door, called:</p>

<p>"Good-wife! Good-wife, awake and let me in!"</p>

<p>"John Louder, wherefore came you so early,
when I thought you had gone to stalk the deer and
would not come before morning?"</p>

<p>"I have seen him!"</p>

<p>"Whom have you seen?"</p>

<p>"The man with the book."</p>

<p>This announcement produced great consternation
in the mind of good-wife Louder. To have seen
the man with the book was an evil omen, and to
sign this book was the loss of one's eternal soul.</p>

<p>"Did you sign it, John?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"God be praised!"</p>

<p>Religious fanaticism is the most dangerous of
all the errors of mankind. A false leader in religion
may be more fatal than an incompetent general
of an army, therefore ministers of the gospel
and teachers have the greatest task imposed on
them of any of God's creation. When once one's
religion runs mad, barbarity assumes the support
of conscience and feels its approval in the consummation
of the most heinous crimes. The Pilgrims
and Puritans who had fled from religious persecutions
across the seas, and had come to the wilderness
to worship God according to their own conscience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
were unwilling to grant the same privilege
to others. For this reason they banished Roger
Williams and persecuted other religious sects not in
accordance with their own views.</p>

<p>They whipped Quakers, bored holes in their
tongues, branded them with hot irons, and even
hung them for their religious views. Why need
one blame Spain for the infamous inquisition, when
the early churches of Protestantism did fully as bad?
Religious fervor controlled by prejudice and ignorance
is the greatest calamity that can befall a nation.</p>

<p>The Quakers appeared first in England about the
time Roger Williams procured his charter for Rhode
Island. The term Quaker now so venerated and
respected was given this sect in derision, just as
the Puritans, Protestants and many other now
respectable sects were named.</p>

<p>Their founder and preachers were among the
boldest and yet the meekest of the non-conformists.
Their morality was so strict that by some they were
denominated ascetics, and this strictness was carried
into every habit and department of life. Extravagant
expenditures, fashionable dress, games of
chance, dancing, attending the theatres and all
amusements, however harmless, were forbidden by
this sect. Even music was discouraged as a seductive
vanity. The members of this church were
forbidden to own slaves, to take part in war, engage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
in lawsuits, indulge in intemperance or profanity,
which, if persisted in, was a cause for the
expulsion of a member from the society, and the
whole body was in duty bound to keep a watch
upon the actions of each other. Their practices so
generally agreed with their principles, that society
was compelled to admit that the profession of a
Quaker or Friend, as they usually styled themselves,
was a guaranty of a morality above the ordinary
level of the world.</p>

<p>The founder of this remarkable sect was George
Fox, a shoemaker of Leicestershire, England, who,
at the early age of nineteen, conceived the idea
that he was called of God to preach the gospel of
the Lord Jesus Christ. He attacked the coldness
and spiritual deadness of all the modes and forms
of religious worship around him, and soon excited
a persecuting spirit which marked his ministerial
life of about forty years as a pilgrimage from one
prison to another. When, in 1650, he was called
before Justice Bennet, of Derby, he admonished
that magistrate to repent and "tremble and <i>quake</i>
before the word of the Lord," at the same time his
own body was violently agitated with his intense
emotions. The magistrate and other officers of the
court then and there named him a "Quaker" out of
derision, a term which the society have since come
to use themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>William Penn, the son of a distinguished English
admiral, became an early convert to this religion.
At an early age, while at college, he embraced the
doctrines and adopted the mode of life of George
Fox and his followers. When his father first
learned that his son was in danger of becoming a
Quaker, he was incredulous. The admiral was a
worldly, ambitious man and had great plans in view
for his son, which would all be blasted if the precocious
youth adopted the new religion. The
struggles of young William Penn with his ambitious
father, were long and bitter. He was beaten
and turned out of doors by his angry parent, then
taken back by the erratic but kind-hearted father
and sent to France to be lured with gayety and
dazzled with promises of wealth and distinction;
but William Penn had the courage of his convictions
and yielded not one whit of his religious
ideas. Conscious of being right, he was unmoved
by either promises or threats, and he even withstood
the fires of persecution.</p>

<p>On one occasion he and another were tried on a
charge of preaching in the streets. The jury, after
being kept without fire, food, or water for two days
and nights, brought in a verdict of "not guilty,"
for which they were each heavily fined by the
court and committed to Newgate prison. Penn
and his companion did not wholly escape, for they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
were fined and imprisoned for contempt of court,
in wearing their hats in the presence of that body.
At this time William Penn was only twenty-four
years of age.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">William Penn.</span></p>

<p>A great many Friends had emigrated to America,
and two had become proprietors of New Jersey.
The first event that drew
Penn's particular attention
to America was when he was
called upon to act as umpire
between the two Quaker
proprietors of New Jersey.
Having the New World thus
thrust upon his attention,
the young convert to the new
religion began to look with
longing eyes across the Atlantic
for a home for himself
and his persecuted brethren.</p>


<p>Shortly afterward, he obtained
from the crown a charter for a vast territory
beyond the Delaware. This charter was given in
payment of a debt of eighty thousand dollars due
to his father from the government. The charter
was perpetual proprietorship given to him and his
heirs, in the fealty of an annual payment of two
beaver skins. In honor of his Welch ancestry,
Penn proposed calling the domain "New Wales;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
but for some reason the secretary of state objected.</p>

<p>Penn, while endeavoring to think up an appropriate
title, suggested that Sylvania would be an
appropriate name for such a woody country. The
secretary who drew up the charter, on the impulse
of the moment, prefixed the name of Penn to Sylvania
in the document. William Penn protested
against the use of his name, as he had no ambition
to be thus distinguished, and offered to pay the
secretary if he would leave it out. This he refused
to do, and Penn next appealed to the king&mdash;"the
merrie King Charlie," who insisted that the province
should be called Pennsylvania, in honor of
his dead friend the admiral. Thus Pennsylvania
received its name. The territory included in
William Penn's charter extended north from New
Castle in Delaware three degrees of latitude and
five degrees of longitude west from the Delaware
River. William Penn was empowered to ordain all
laws with the consent of the freemen, subject to the
approval of the king. No taxes were to be raised
save by the provincial assembly, and permission
was given to the clergymen of the Anglican church
to reside within the province without molestation.</p>

<p>The charter for Pennsylvania was granted on
March 14, 1681, and in the following May, Penn
sent William Markham, a relative, to take possession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
of his province and act as deputy governor.
A large number of emigrants in the employ of the
"company of free traders" who had purchased lands
in Pennsylvania of the proprietor, went with him.
These settled near the Delaware and "builded and
planted."</p>

<p>With the assistance of Algernon Sidney, a sturdy
republican, who soon after perished on the scaffold
for his views on personal liberty, Penn drew up a
code of laws for the government of the colony, that
were wise, liberal and benevolent, and next year
sent them to the settlers in Pennsylvania for their
approval.</p>

<p>William Penn soon discovered that his colony
was liable to suffer for the want of sea-board room.
He coveted Delaware for that purpose, and resolved
if possible to have it. This territory, however,
was claimed by Lord Baltimore as a part of Maryland,
and for some time had been a matter of dispute
between him and the Duke of York. For the
sake of peace, the latter offered to purchase the territory
of Baltimore; but the baron would not sell
it. Penn then assured the Duke that Lord Baltimore's
claim was "against law, civil and common."
The duke gladly assented to the opinion, and the
worldly-wise Quaker obtained from his grace a quitclaim
deed for the territory, now comprising the
whole of the State of Delaware.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as William Penn had accomplished his
purpose, he made immediate preparations for going
to America, and within a week after the bargain
was officially settled, he sailed in the ship
<i>Welcome</i>, with one hundred emigrants, in August,
1682. Many of his emigrants died from small-pox
on the voyage; but with the remainder he arrived,
early in November, at New Castle, where he found
almost a thousand emigrants. In addition to these,
there were about three thousand old settlers&mdash;Swedes,
Dutch, Huguenots, Germans and English&mdash;enough
to form the material for the solid foundation
of a State.</p>

<p>There Penn received from the agent of the Duke
of York, and in the presence of all the people, a
formal surrender of all that fine domain. The
Dutch had long before conquered and absorbed the
Swedes on the Delaware, and the English in turn
had conquered the Dutch, and it was by virtue of
his charter, giving him a title to all New Netherland,
that the duke claimed the territory as his own.
The transfer inherited for Penn and his descendants
a dispute with the proprietors of Maryland, which
might seem incompatible with the views of Quakers.
William Penn, in honor of the duke, attempted
to change the name of Cape Henlopen to
Cape James; but geography is sometimes arbitrary
and refuses to change at will of rulers, and Henlopen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
and May preserve their original names given
them by the Dutch.</p>

<p>It was the earliest days in November when
William Penn, with a few friends, set out in an
open boat and journeyed up the river to the beautiful
bank, fringed with pine trees, on which the city
of Philadelphia was soon to rise.</p>

<p>On this occasion was made that famous treaty
with the Indians, with which every school-boy is
acquainted. Beneath a huge elm at Shakamaxon,
on the northern edge of Philadelphia, William
Penn, surrounded by a few friends, in the habiliments
of peace, met the numerous delegations of
the Lenni-Lenape tribes. The great treaty was
not for the purchase of lands; but, confirming
what Penn had written and Markham covenanted,
its sublime purpose was the recognition of the equal
rights of humanity, under the shelter of the forest
trees, barren of leaves from the effects of the early
frosts. Penn proclaimed to the men of the Algonkin
race, from both banks of the Delaware, from
the borders of the Schuylkill, and, it may have
been, even from the Susquehannah, the same simple
message of peace and love which George Fox
had professed before Cromwell, and which Mary
Fisher had borne to the Grand Turk. He argued
that the English and the Indian should respect the
same moral law, should be alike secure in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
pursuits and their possessions, and should adjust
every difference by a peaceful tribunal, to be composed
of an equal number of wise and discreet men
from each race. Penn said:</p>

<p>"We meet on the broad pathway of good faith
and good-will. No advantage will be taken on
either side; but all shall be openness and love. I
will not call you children, for parents sometimes
chide their children too severely, nor brothers only,
for brothers differ. The friendship between me
and you, I will not compare to a chain, for that
rains might rust, or the falling tree might break.
We are the same as if one man's body were divided
into two parts. We are all one flesh and blood."</p>

<p>The sincerity of the speaker, as well as his sacred
doctrine, touched the hearts of the forest children,
and they renounced their guile and their revenge.
The presents which Penn offered were received in
sincerity, and with hearty friendship they gave the
belt of wampum.</p>

<p>"We will live," said they, "in love with William
Penn and his children, as long as the moon and the
sun shall endure."</p>

<p>Mr. Bancroft says: "This agreement of peace
and friendship was made under the open sky, by
the side of the Delaware, with the sun and river
and the forest for witnesses. It was not confirmed
by an oath; it was not ratified by signatures and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
seals; no record of the conference can be found,
and its terms and conditions had no abiding inscription
but on the heart. There they were written
like the law of God. The simple sons of the wilderness,
returning to their wigwams, kept the history
of the covenant by strings of wampum, and, long
afterward, in their cabins, would count over the
shells on a clean piece of bark and recall to their
own memory and repeat to their children or to the
stranger the words of William Penn. New England
had just terminated a disastrous war of extermination.
The Dutch were scarcely ever at peace
with the Algonkins. The laws of Maryland refer
to Indian hostilities and massacres, which extended
as far as Richmond. Penn came without arms; he
declared his purpose to abstain from violence; he
had no message but peace, and not a drop of Quaker
blood was shed in his time by an Indian.</p>

<p>"Was there not progress from Melendez to Roger
Williams? from Cortez and Pizarro to William
Penn? The Quakers, ignorant of the homage
which their virtues would receive from Voltaire
and Raynal, men so unlike themselves, exulted in
the consciousness of their humanity. 'We have
done better,' said they truly, 'than if, with the
proud Spaniards, we had gained the mines of
Potosi. We may make the ambitious heroes, whom
the world admires, blush for their shameful victories.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
To the poor, dark souls around about us
we teach their rights as men.'"</p>

<p>After the treaty, Penn again journeyed through
New Jersey to New York and Long Island, visiting
friends and preaching with his usual fervor and
earnestness. Then he returned to the Delaware,
and, on the seventh day of November, he went to
Uplands (now Chester), where he met the first provincial
assembly of his province. There he made
known his benevolent designs toward all men,
civilized and savage, and excited the love and reverence
of all hearers. The assembly tendered their
grateful acknowledgment to him, and the Swedes
authorized one of their number to say to him in
their name that they "would live, serve and obey
him with all they had," declaring that it was "the
best day they ever saw." He informed the assembly
of the union of the "territories" (as Delaware
was called) with his province, and received their
congratulations. Then and there was laid the
foundation for the great commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>One matter still remained to be adjusted, and
that was some satisfactory arrangement with the
third Lord Baltimore, concerning the boundary
lines. This at last having been amicably adjusted,
Penn went up the Delaware in an open boat to
Wicaco, to attend the founding of a city, to which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
allusion had been made in his concessions in 1681.
Before his arrival in America, Penn had thought
of this city he was to found, and resolved to give
it the name of Philadelphia&mdash;a Greek word signifying
brotherly love&mdash;as a token of the principles in
which he intended to govern his province.</p>

<p>Near a block-house constructed by the Swedes,
but which had since been converted into a church,
he purchased lands extending from the high banks
of the Delaware, fringed with pines, to those of the
Schuylkill. There his surveyor laid out the city
of Philadelphia upon a plan which would embrace
about twelve square miles.</p>

<p>The surveyor who aided William Penn in laying
out Philadelphia was Thomas Holme. It was at
the close of the year 1682, that the town was surveyed,
and the boundaries of the streets marked on
the trunks of the chestnut, walnut, locust, spruce,
pine and other forest trees covering the land.
Many of the streets were named for the forest monarchs
on which these inscriptions were cut, and still
bear the names. The growth of the town was
rapid, and, within a year after the surveyor had
finished this work, almost a hundred houses had
been erected there, and the Indians daily came
with the fruits of the chase as presents for "Father
Penn," as they delighted to call the proprietor.</p>

<p>In the following March, the new city was honored<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
by the gathering there of the second assembly of
the province, when Penn offered to the people,
through their representatives a new charter. The
new charter was so liberal in all its provisions,
that when he asked the question:</p>

<p>"Shall we accept the new constitution or adhere
to the old one?" they voted in a body to accept
the new charter, and became at once a representative
republican government, with free religious toleration,
with justice, for its foundation, and the
proprietor, unlike those of other provinces, surrendered
to the people his chartered rights in the
appointment of officers. From the beginning, the
happiness and prosperity of his people appeared to
be uppermost in the heart and mind of William
Penn. It was this happy relation between the proprietor
and the people, and the security against
Indian raids, that made Pennsylvania far outstrip
her sister colonies in rapidity of settlement and
permanent prosperity.</p>

<p>It was late in 1682 that a small house was erected
on the site of Philadelphia for the use of Penn,
and only a few years ago it was still standing between
Front and Second Streets, occupied by Letitia
Court.</p>

<p>There he assisted in fashioning those excellent
laws which gave a high character to Pennsylvania
from the beginning. Among other wise provisions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
was a board of arbitrators called peace-makers, who
were to adjust all difficulties and thus prevent lawsuits.
The children were all taught some useful
trade. When factors wronged their employees,
they were to make satisfaction and one-third over.
All causes for irreligion and vulgarity were to be
suppressed, and no man was to be molested for his
religious opinions. It was also decreed that the
days of the week and the months of the year "shall
be called as in Scripture, and not by heathen names
(as are vulgarly used), as ye First, Second and
Third months of ye year, beginning with ye day
called Sunday, and ye month called March," thus
beginning the year, as of old, with the first spring
month. Pennsylvania was first divided into three
counties&mdash;Bucks, Chester and Philadelphia, and the
annexed territories were also divided into three
counties&mdash;New Castle, Kent and Sussex&mdash;known
for a long time afterward as the "Three Lower
Counties on the Delaware."</p>

<p>Penn returned to England in the summer of 1684,
leaving the government of the province during his
absence to five members of the council, of which
Thomas Lloyd, the president, held the great seal.
William Penn's mission in America had been one
of success. In 1685, Philadelphia contained six
hundred houses; schools were established, and
William Bradford had set up a printing press. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
printed his "Almanac for the year of the Christian's
Account, 1687," a broadside, or single sheet, with
twelve compartments, the year beginning with
March.</p>

<p>William Penn could look with no little degree
of pride upon his work. If ever man was justified
in being proud, he was. Looking upon the result
of his work, he, with righteous exultation, wrote
to Lord Halifax, "I must, without vanity, say I
have led the greatest colony into America that ever
man did upon private credit, and the most prosperous
beginnings that ever were in it are to be
found among us."</p>

<p>Penn bade the colonists farewell, with the
brightest hopes for the future, saying, "My love
and my life are to and with you, and no water can
quench it, nor distance bring it to an end. I have
been with you, cared for you, and served you with
unfeigned love, and you are beloved of me and
dear to me beyond utterance. I bless you in the
name and power of the Lord, and may God bless
you with his righteousness, peace and plenty all
the land over." Then of Philadelphia, the apple
of the noble Quaker's eye, he said, "And thou,
Philadelphia, the virgin settlement of this province,
my soul prays to God for thee, that thou mayest
stand in the day of trial, and that thy children may
be blessed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>He stood on the deck of the ship which was anchored
at the foot of Chestnut Street, when he delivered
his farewell address, and on that bright
August day, when the good ship spread her sails
and sped away across the seas, he bore away with
him to England the blessings of the whole people.</p>

<p>Four months after Penn's return to England,
Charles the Second died, and his brother James
ascended the throne. A period of theological and
political excitement in England followed, in which
William Penn became involved. William Penn
and the new king had long been personal friends,
and through the influence of the honest Quaker,
twelve hundred persecuted Friends were released
from prison, in 1686. As James was under the
influence of the Jesuits, his Quaker friend was suspected
of being one of them, and when the revolution
that drove James from the throne came, Penn
was three times arrested on false charges of treason
and as often acquitted, his last acquittal being in
1690. There had meanwhile been great political
and theological commotions in Pennsylvania, and
in April, 1691, the three lower counties on the Delaware,
offended at the action of the council at Philadelphia,
withdrew from the union, and Penn
yielded to the secessionists so far as to appoint a separate
deputy governor over them.</p>

<p>In consequence of representations which came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
from Pennsylvania, the monarchs William and
Mary deprived Penn of his rights as governor of
his province, in 1692, and the control of the domain
was placed in the hands of Governor Fletcher of
New York, who, in the spring of 1693, reunited
the Delaware counties to the parent province.
Fletcher appeared at the head of the council at
Philadelphia on Monday, the 15th of May, with
William Markham, Penn's deputy, as lieutenant
governor.</p>

<p>The noble Quaker, however, had powerful friends
who interceded with King William for the restoration
of Penn's rights. He was called before the
Privy Council to answer certain accusations, when
his innocence was proven, and a few months later,
all his ancient rights were restored.</p>

<p>Penn's fortune had been wasted, and he lingered
in England, under the heavy hand of poverty,
until 1699, when, with his daughter and second
wife, Hannah Callowhill, he sailed to Philadelphia.
Meanwhile, his colony, under his old deputy,
William Markham, had asserted their right to self-government
and made laws for themselves.</p>

<p>They were prosperous, but clamorous for political
privileges guaranteed to them by law. Regarding
their demands as reasonable, Penn, in November,
1701, gave them a new form of government, with
more liberal concessions than had been formerly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
given. The people of the territories or three lower
counties were still restive under the forced union
with Pennsylvania, and Penn made provisions for
their permanent separation in legislation, in 1702,
and the first independent legislature in Delaware
was assembled at New Castle in 1703. Although
Philadelphia and Delaware ever afterward continued
to have separate legislatures, they were under
the same government until the Revolution in
1776.</p>

<p>Shortly after Penn's arrival in America, he received
tidings that measures were pending before
the privy council, for bringing all of the proprietary
governments under the crown. Penn located in
Philadelphia, declaring it his intention to live
and die there. He erected an excellent brick
house on the corner of Second Street and Norris
Alley.</p>

<p>Disparaging news from his native land determined
him to return to England, which he did in 1701,
where he succeeded in setting matters to rights.
He never returned to America. Harassed and
wearied by business connected with his province,
he was making arrangements in 1712 to sell it for
sixty thousand dollars, when he was prostrated
with paralysis. He survived the first shock six
years, though he never fully recovered, then he
died, leaving his estates in America to his three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
sons. His family governed Pennsylvania, as proprietors,
until the Revolution made it an independent
State, in 1776. During that time the great
province of Pennsylvania had borne its share of
troubles with the French and Indians.</p>

<p>That which was most dreaded in New England
and all the American colonies came to pass.
Charles II. died, and his brother James, Duke of
York, was crowned King of England. On ascending
the throne, the very first act of James II. was
one of honest but imprudent bigotry. Incapable
of reading the signs of the times, or fully prepared
to dare the worst that those signs could portend,
James immediately sent his agent Caryl to Rome,
to apologize to the pope for the long and flagrant
heresy of England, and to endeavor to procure the
re-admission of the English people into the communion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of the Catholic Church. The pope was
more politic than the king and returned him a very
cool answer, implying that before he ventured upon
so arduous an enterprise as that of changing the
professed faith of nearly his entire people, he would
do well to sit down and calculate the cost.</p>

<p>The foolish king, who stopped at nothing, not
even the mild rebuke of the holy father, would
not open his eyes, and as a natural result he was
soon cordially hated by nearly all his subjects.
His brother had left an illegitimate son called the
Duke of Monmouth, who was encouraged to attempt
to seize the throne of his uncle. At first the cause
of the duke seemed prosperous. His army swelled
from hundreds to thousands; but, owing to his lack
of energy and fondness for pleasure, he delayed
and gave the royal armies time to recruit. He was
attacked at Sedgemore, near Bridgewater, and,
owing to the perfidity or cowardice of Gray, his
cavalry general, the rebels were defeated. Monmouth
was captured, and his uncle ordered him
beheaded, which was done.</p>

<p>Then commenced the most barbarous punishment
of rebels ever known. An officer named Kirk
was sent by the king to hunt down the Monmouth
rebels, or those sympathizing with them. His
atrocious deeds would fill a volume, and are so
revolting as to seem incredible. Another brutal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
ruffian of the time was Judge Jeffries. The
judicial ermine has often been disgraced by prejudiced
judges; but Jeffries was the worst monster
that ever sat on the bench. He hung men with
as much relish as did Berkeley of Virginia. His
term was called the "bloody assizes," and to this
day the name of Judge Jeffries is applied in
reproach to the scandalous ruling of a partial
judiciary.</p>

<p>The accession of James II. made fewer changes
in the American colonies than was anticipated.
Perhaps, had his reign been longer, the changes
would have been greater. The suppression of Monmouth's
rebellion gave to the colonies many useful
citizens. Men connect themselves, in the eyes of
posterity, with the objects in which they take
delight. James II. was inexorable toward his
brother's favorites. Monmouth was beheaded, and
the triumph of legitimacy was commemorated by a
medal, representing the heads of Monmouth and
Argyle on an altar, their bleeding bodies beneath,
with the following: "Sic aras et sceptra tuemur."
("Thus we defend our altars and our throne.")</p>

<p>"Lord chief justice is making his campaign in
the west," wrote James II. to one in Europe, referring
to Jeffries' circuit for punishing the insurgents.
"He has already condemned several hundreds,
some of whom we are already executed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
more are to be, and the others sent to the plantations."
The prisoners condemned to transportation
were a salable commodity. Such was the demand
for labor in America that convicts and laborers
were regularly purchased and shipped to the colonies
where they were sold as indented servants. The
courtiers round James II. exulted in the rich harvest
which the rebellion promised, and begged of
the monarch frequent gifts of their condemned
countrymen. Jeffries heard of the scramble, and
indignantly addressed the king:</p>

<p>"I beseech your majesty, that I inform you, that
each prisoner will be worth ten pound, if not fifteen
pound, apiece, and, sir, if your majesty orders
these as you have already designed, persons that
have not suffered in the service will run away with
the booty." Under this appeal of the lord chief
justice the spoils were divided and his honor was
in part gratified. Many of the convicts were persons
of family and education, and were accustomed
to ease and elegance.</p>

<p>"Take all care," wrote the monarch, under the
countersign of Sunderland, to the government in
Virginia, "take all care that they continue to serve
for ten years at least, and that they be not permitted
in any manner to redeem themselves by
money or otherwise, until that term be fully expired.
Prepare a bill for the assembly of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
colony, with such clauses as shall be requisite for
this purpose."</p>

<p>No legislature in any of the American colonies
seconded such malice, for the colonies were never
in full accord with James II. Tyranny and injustice
peopled America with men nurtured to suffering
and adversity. The history of our colonization
is the history of the crimes of Europe, and some of
the best families in America are descended from
the indented servants of the Old World.</p>

<p>In Bristol, kidnapping had become common, and
not only felons, but young persons of birth and
education were hurried across the Atlantic and sold
for money.</p>

<p>Never did a king prove a greater tyrant or more
inhuman and cruel than James II. After the insurrection
of Monmouth had been suppressed, all
the sanguinary excesses of despotic revenge were
revived. Gibbets were erected in villages to intimidate
the people, and soldiers were intrusted with
the execution of the laws. Scarce a Presbyterian
family in Scotland, but was involved in proscription
or penalties. The jails were overflowed, and
their tenants were sent as slaves to the colonies.
Maddened by the succession of murders; driven
from their homes to caves, from caves to morasses
and mountains; death brought to the inmates of a
house that should shelter them; death to the benefactor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
that should throw them food; death to the
friend that listened to their complaint; death to
the wife or parent that still dared to solace husband
or son; ferreted out by spies; hunted with dogs;&mdash;the
fanatics turned upon their pursuers, and threatened
to retaliate on the men who should still continue
to imbrue their hands in blood. The council
retorted by ordering a massacre. He that would
not take the oath should be executed, though unarmed,
and the recusants were shot on the roads,
or as they labored in the field, or stood at prayer.
To fly was admission of guilt; to excite suspicion
was sentence of death; to own the covenant was
treason.</p>

<p>Sometimes the lot of an indented slave was a
happy one. Hundreds and thousands of fugitives
flying from persecution came to the New World,
while thousands of others were sent as convicts.</p>

<p>Virginia received her share of the latter.</p>

<p>One bright spring morning a ship from England
entered the James River with a number of these indented
slaves to be sold to the planters. Notice had
been given of the intended sale and many planters
came to look at the poor wretches huddled together
like so many beasts in an old shed, and guarded by
soldiers. Mr. Thomas Hull, a planter of considerable
means, and a man noted for his iron will, was
among those who came to make purchases.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Thomas, have you looked over the lot?"
asked another planter.</p>

<p>"No, Bradley, have you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, though I am shortened in money, and unable
to purchase to-day."</p>

<p>"Well, Bradley, what have you seen among
them?"</p>

<p>"There are many fine, lusty fellows; but I was
most interested and grieved in one."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He is a man who has known refinement and
ease, is perchance thirty-five and has with him a
child."</p>

<p>"A child?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a maid not to exceed ten years, but very
beautiful with her golden hair and soft blue eyes."</p>

<p>"Is the child a slave?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then wherefore is it here?" asked Hull.</p>

<p>"His is truly a pathetic story as I have heard it.
It seems he was a widower with his child wandering
about the country, when he fell in with some
of the Duke of Monmouth's people and enlisted.
He was captured at Sedgemore, and condemned by
Jeffries. The child was left to wander at will; but
by some means she accompanied her father, managed
to smuggle herself on shipboard, and was not discovered
until the vessel was well out to sea. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the captain, who was a humane man, permitted
them to remain together to the end of the voyage.
She is with her father now, and a prettier little
maid I never saw."</p>

<p>"By the mass! I will go and see her," cried
Hull. "If she be all you say, I will buy them
both."</p>

<p>"But she is not for sale."</p>

<p>"Wherefore not?"</p>

<p>"She was not adjudged by the court."</p>

<p>With the cold, heartless laugh of a natural
tyrant, Hull answered:</p>

<p>"It will be all the same. He who purchases the
father will have the maid also."</p>

<p>He went to the place where the slaves were confined
and gazed on the lot, very much as a cattle
dealer might look upon a herd he contemplated
purchasing. His gaze soon fastened on a fine,
manly person in whose proud eye the sullen fires
were but half subdued. He stood with his arms
folded across his broad chest and his eye fixed upon
a beautiful girl at his side.</p>

<p>The captive spoke not. A pair of handcuffs
were on his wrists, and the chains came almost to
the ground; but slavery and chains could not subdue
the proud captive.</p>

<p>Hull delighted in punishing those whom he disliked.
He was a papist at heart and consequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
in sympathy with James II., so for this indented
slave he incurred from the very first a most bitter
dislike. When the slave was brought forth to be
sold, he bid twelve pounds for him. This was
two pounds more than the required price, and he
became the purchaser.</p>

<p>"You are mine," cried Hull to the servant.
"Come with me." The father turned his great
brown eyes dim with moisture upon his child, and
Hull, interpreting the look, added, "Hold, I will
buy the maid also."</p>

<p>"She cannot be sold," the officer in charge of
the slaves answered, "unless the master of the ship
sees fit to sell her for passage money."</p>

<p>The master of the ship was present and declared
he would do nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>"I will take her back to England, if she wishes
to return," he added.</p>

<p>The child was speechless, her great blue eyes
fixed on her father.</p>

<p>"What will you do with the maid?" asked Hull,
who, having the father, felt sure the child would
follow.</p>

<p>"I will return her to England free of charge, if
she wills it."</p>

<p>"Who will care for her there?" asked Hull.
"Do you know her relatives?"</p>

<p>"No; all are strangers to me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>The father, with his proud breast heaving with
tumultuous emotion, stood silently gazing on the
scene. He was a slave and he remembered that a
slave must not speak unless permission be granted
him by his master; but it was his child, the only
link that bound him to earth, whose fate they were
to decide, and, had he been unfettered, he might
have clasped her to his bosom.</p>

<p>"Speak with the maid," suggested a by-stander,
"and see if she has a friend in England who will
care for her."</p>

<p>The master of the ship went to the bewildered
child and, taking her little hand in his broad palm,
said:</p>

<p>"Sweet little maid, you are not afraid to trust
me?"</p>

<p>She turned her great blue eyes up to him and,
in a whisper, answered:</p>

<p>"I am not."</p>

<p>"Have you a mother?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Have you any friends in England?"</p>

<p>"None, since my father came away."</p>

<p>"Where did you live before your father enlisted
in the army of Monmouth?"</p>

<p>"We travelled; we lived at no one place."</p>

<p>"Have you no friends or relatives in England?"</p>

<p>"None."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain then asked permission to talk with
the father. The permission was given by Hull,
for he saw that his slave had the sympathy of all
present, and it would not be safe to refuse him
some privileges. The master of the vessel and the
magistrate who had superintended the selling of
the slaves for the crown found the slave a very intelligent
gentleman. He said he had but one relative
living so far as he knew. He had a brother
who had come to America two or three years before;
but he had not heard from him, and he might
be dead.</p>

<p>"Do you know any one in England to whom
your child could be sent?"</p>

<p>"I do not."</p>

<p>"What were you doing before you entered the
duke's army?"</p>

<p>"I was a strolling player," the man answered,
his fine tragic eyes fixed firmly on the officers.
"My company had reached a town one day, in
which we were to play at night, and just as I was
getting ready to go to the theatre, the Duke of
Monmouth entered. He was on his way to Sedgemore,
and I was forced to join him. My child
followed on foot and watched the battle as it raged.
When it was over I could have escaped, had I not
come upon Cora, who was seeking me. I took
her up in my arms and was hurrying away, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the cavalry of the enemy overtook me and I was
made a prisoner."</p>

<p>The simple story made an impression on all who
heard it save the obdurate master. The magistrate
asked the slave what he would have done with his
child.</p>

<p>"Let her stay in the colony until my term of
service is ended, then I will labor to remunerate
any who would keep her."</p>

<p>At this Hull said he would take the maid, and
she might always be near the father. All who
knew Hull looked with suspicion on the proposition.</p>

<p>A new-comer had arrived on the scene. This
was a young man of about the same age as the
prisoner. He was a wealthy Virginian named
Robert Stevens, noted for his kindness of heart and
charity. He did not arrive on the scene until after
the indented slave had been sold; but he soon heard
the story of the captive from Sedgemore and his
child. Robert Stevens' heart at once went out to
these unfortunates, and he resolved on a scheme to
make the father practically free.</p>

<p>"Has the slave been sold?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He has, and I am the purchaser," answered
Hull.</p>

<p>"How much did you give for him?"</p>

<p>"Twelve pounds."</p>

<p>"I will give fifty."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is already sold," repeated Hull exultingly.
He despised Robert Stevens for his wealth and
popularity. To have purchased a slave whom
Robert Stevens wanted, was great glory for Hull.</p>

<p>"Fear not, good man," said Robert to the unfortunate
slave. "I have money enough to purchase
your freedom."</p>

<p>Unfortunately those words fell on the ears of
Thomas Hull, and he answered:</p>

<p>"It is the order of the king that all serve their
term out, and none be allowed to purchase their
freedom."</p>

<p>"I will give you one hundred pounds for the
slave," cried Robert.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"A thousand!"</p>

<p>"Robert Stevens, for some reason you want this
slave restored to liberty."</p>

<p>"No. Sell him to me, and he shall serve out
his term."</p>

<p>"I understand your plan. You would make his
servitude a luxury. You cannot have the slave for
a hundred times the sum you offer. By law, the
convict is fairly mine until he hath fully served his
term. I am not so heartless as you deem me. His
child can go to my house, where she will be cared
for."</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" cried the captive, his eyes turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
appealingly to Robert Stevens. "You take her;
you take her. Go with him, Cora."</p>

<p>The child sprang to the side of Robert Stevens,
for already she had come to dread the man who
was her father's master. Hull's face was black
with rage. He bit his lips, but said nothing.
With his slave, he hurried home.</p>

<p>The name of the slave was George Waters, and
he was soon to learn the weight of a master's hand.</p>

<p>Thomas Hull was the owner of negro slaves, as
well as white indented servants, and he made no
distinction between them. George Waters, proud,
noble as he was, was set to work with the filthy
negroes in the tobacco fields. The half-savage barbarians,
with their ignorance and naturally low
instincts, were intended to humiliate the refined
gentleman.</p>

<p>"You is one of us," said a negro. "What am
your name?"</p>

<p>"George Waters."</p>

<p>"George&mdash;George, dat am my name, too," said
the negro, leaning on his hoe. "D'ye suppose we
is brudders?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, why is we bofe called George?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>The overseer came along at this moment and
threatened them with the lash, if they did not cease<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
talking and attend to their work. Again and again
was the proud George Waters subjected to indignities,
until he could scarcely restrain himself from
knocking Martin, his overseer, down, and selling
his life in the defence of his liberty; but he remembered
Cora, and resolved to bear taunts and indignities
for her sake, until his term of service was
ended. His only comfort was that his child was
well cared for.</p>

<p>He had been a year and a half on the upper
plantation of Thomas Hull, and though he had
demeaned himself well, and had done the labor of
two ordinary men&mdash;though he had never uttered a
word of complaint, no matter what burdens were
laid upon him, his natural pride and nobility of
character won the hatred of the overseer. The
fellow had a violent temper and hated George
Waters.</p>

<p>One day, from no provocation at all, he threatened
to beat Waters. The servant snatched the
whip from his hand and said:</p>

<p>"I would do you no harm, sir. I have always
performed my tasks to the best of my ability, and
never have I complained; but if you so much as
give me one stroke, I will kill you."</p>

<p>There was fire in his eye and an earnestness in
his voice, which awed the cowardly overseer; but
at the same time they increased his hatred. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
resolved to be revenged, and reported to Hull that
the slave was rebellious. Hull permitted George
Waters to be tied to a tree by four stout negroes,
whose barbarous natures delighted in such work,
and the overseer laid a whip a dozen times about
his bare shoulders. No groan escaped his lips.
For three days he lay about his miserable lodge
waiting for his wounds to heal, and meanwhile
made up his mind to fly from the colony.</p>

<p>He had heard that a society of Friends, or
Quakers, had formed a colony to the north, which
was called Pennsylvania; and he knew that they
would succor a slave. As soon as he was well
enough, he stole from a cabin a gun, a knife and
some ammunition, and set out in the night to find
the plantation of Robert Stevens, where Cora was.
His escape was discovered and the overseer, with
Thomas Hull, set out in hot pursuit of the fugitive.
At dawn of day they came in sight of him in the
forest on the Lower James River and, being on
horseback, gave chase.</p>

<p>"Keep away! keep back!" cried the fugitive,
"or I will not answer for the consequences," and
he brandished his gun in the air. The overseer
was armed with pistols and, drawing one, galloped
up to within a hundred paces of the fugitive and
fired, but missed. Quick as thought, George
Waters raised his gun and, taking aim at the breast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
of his would-be slayer, shot him dead from the
saddle.</p>

<p>The body fell to the ground, and the frightened
horse wheeled about and ran away. Thomas Hull,
who was a coward, awed by the fate of his overseer,
turned and fled as rapidly as his horse could go.</p>

<p>Horrified at what he had done, and knowing
that death, sure and swift, would follow his capture,
George Waters turned and fled down the
James River. Some guardian angel guided his
footsteps, for he found himself one night, almost
starved, faint and weak, at the plantation of Robert
Stevens. George was driven to desperate straits
when he accosted the wealthy planter and asked
for food. Robert recognized him as the father of
the little maid whom he had taken to his home
as one of his family.</p>

<p>"I have heard all; you must not be seen," said
Robert. Then he conducted him to an apartment
of his large manor house. "Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>"I am starving."</p>

<p>Robert brought him food with his own hands
and, as he ate, asked:</p>

<p>"Do you want to see Cora?"</p>

<p>"May I?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I am a slave and a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know what you would say. Do not say it,
for you slew only in self-defence."</p>

<p>"But I will be hanged if found."</p>

<p>"You shall not be found. Heaven help me, if
I shield a real criminal from justice; but he who
strikes a blow for liberty is worthy of aid."</p>

<p>After the fugitive had in a measure satisfied his
hunger, Robert said:</p>

<p>"You will need sleep and rest, after which you
must prepare for a long journey."</p>

<p>"Whither shall I go?"</p>

<p>"To Massachusetts. I have relatives in Salem,
where you will be safe."</p>

<p>"Safe!"</p>

<p>He repeated the word as if it were a glorious
dream&mdash;a vision never to be realized.</p>

<p>"Yes, you will be safe; but as you must make
the journey through a vast forest, you will need to
be refreshed by rest and food."</p>

<p>The wild-eyed fugitive, with his face haggard as
death, seized the arm of his benefactor and said:</p>

<p>"They will come and slay me as I sleep."</p>

<p>"Fear not, my unfortunate brother, for I will
put you in a chamber where none save myself shall
know of you."</p>

<p>"And my child?"</p>

<p>"She shall accompany you to Salem."</p>

<p>The fugitive said no more. He entrusted everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
to the man who had promised to save him.
He was led up two flights of stairs, when they
came to a ladder reaching to an attic, and they
went up this attic ladder to a chamber, where there
was a narrow bed, with soft, clean sheets and pillows,
the first the prisoner had seen in the New
World.</p>

<p>"You can sleep here in perfect security," said
Robert. "I will see that you are not molested by
any one."</p>

<p>The wayworn traveller threw himself on the bed
and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Stevens went below and told his wife of the fugitive.
Ester Stevens was the daughter of General
Goffe, the regicide, who had been hunted for years
by Charles II. for signing the death warrant of
the king's father and serving in the army of Oliver
Cromwell, and Mrs. Stevens could sympathize with
a political fugitive. They ran some risk in keeping
him in their house; but as a majority of the
colonists had been in sympathy with the Duke of
Monmouth, for James II. had few friends in Virginia
and Thomas Hull none, their risk was not as
great as it might seem.</p>

<p>The fugitive late next day awoke, and Robert
carried his breakfast to him. The colony was wild
with excitement over the escape of an indented
slave and the killing of the overseer. Thomas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Hull represented the crime to be as heinous as possible,
to arouse a sympathy for himself and a hatred
for the escaped slave. Some people were outspoken
in the belief that the escaped slave should
be killed; others were in sympathy with him.
They reasoned that Hull had been a hard master,
and that this poor fellow was no criminal, but a
patriot, for which he had been adjudged to ten
years' penal servitude.</p>

<p>Many of the searchers came to the mansion house
of Stevens; but he managed to put them off the
track.</p>

<p>For five days and nights George Waters remained
in the attic. On the sixth night Robert Stevens
came to him and said:</p>

<p>"You must now set out on your journey."</p>

<p>"But Cora&mdash;can I see her?"</p>

<p>"She will accompany you. Here is a suit of
clothes more befitting one of your rank and station,
than the garb of an indented slave." He placed a
riding suit with top boots and hat in the apartment.
When he had attired himself, Robert next brought
him some arms, a splendid gun and a brace of
pistols of the best make.</p>

<p>"You may have need of these," said the planter.
"You will also find holsters in the saddle."</p>

<p>"And does Cora know of this?"</p>

<p>"I have told her all."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>The father shuddered. In the pride of his soul,
he remembered that he was a slave, had felt the
lash, and was humiliated.</p>

<p>Under a wide-spreading chestnut near the planter's
mansion, stood three horses ready saddled. A
faithful negro slave was holding them, and the little
maid, clothed for a long journey, awaited her
father's arrival. A fourth horse was near on which
were a pack of provisions and a small camping outfit.</p>

<p>The father and child met and embraced in silence,
and, had she not felt a tear on her face, she would
hardly have known that he was so greatly agitated.</p>

<p>"We will mount and be far on the journey before
the day dawns," said Robert.</p>

<p>"Do you go with us?" asked George Waters.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I know the country and will guide
you beyond danger."</p>

<p>They mounted and travelled all night long. At
early dawn, they halted only to refresh themselves
with a cold breakfast, and pushed on.</p>

<p>Three days Robert journeyed with them, and
then, on the border of Maryland, he halted and
told them of a land now within their reach, where
the Quakers dwelt. There they might rest until
they were able to go to Massachusetts. He gave a
purse of gold to the father, saying:</p>

<p>"Take it, and may God be as good to you as he
has been to me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>The fugitive murmured out some words of thanks;
but his benefactor wheeled his steed about and galloped
away, lest the words of gratitude might fall
on his ears.</p>

<p>"Let us go on, father," said Cora.</p>

<p>For days, Cora Waters could never tell how long,
they journeyed, until at last, on the banks of the
Delaware, they came upon a small town where
dwelt a people at peace with all the world&mdash;the
Quakers, and the tired child and her father were
taken in, given food and shelter, Christian sympathy,
and assured of safety.</p>

<p>The last expiring throe of a mighty superstition
was about to convulse the little society at Salem,
and, as usual in such cases, ignorance and prejudice
went hand in hand for the destruction of reason
and humanity. The last of the great religious persecutions
was to begin, when eminent divines were
to stand and point with pride to the swaying bodies
of their victims, hanging from the gibbet, and call
them "fire-brands of hell."</p>

<p>In the village of Salem, there was a strife between
Samuel Parris the minister and a part of his people;
a strife so bitter, that it had even attracted the attention
of a general court. We all know, even in
these modern days, what a furor can be created in
a church, when a part of the organization is arrayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
against the pastor. Sometimes the divine
shepherd loses his temper and says ugly things
against his flock, and thinks many which he does
not utter.</p>

<p>Parris was a man filled with ambition and prejudice.
He was a fanatic and easily driven to frenzy
by opposition. An unfavorable criticism upset his
highly nervous organism, and he set out to find
some proof in the Scriptures for condemning his
enemies. It never entered into his mind to love
those who hated him.</p>

<p>Mr. Parris had lived in the West Indies for several
years before going to Salem, and had brought
with him some slaves purchased from the Spaniards.
Among them were two famous in history as John
and Tituba his wife. Historians disagree as to the
nationality of these slaves. Some aver they were
Indians, others call them negroes, while some state
they were half and half. Whatever may have
been their nationality, their practices were the
fetichism of western Africa, and there can be no
doubt that negro blood predominated in their veins.
All their training, their low cunning and beastly
worship, their deception and treachery were utterly
unlike the characteristics of the early aborigines of
America, and were purely African.</p>

<p>John and Tituba were full of the gross superstitions
of their people, and were of the frame and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
temperament best adapted to the practice of demonology.</p>

<p>In the family of Samuel Parris, his daughter, a
child of nine years, and his niece, a girl of less than
twelve, began to have strange caprices. During
such a state of affairs the pastor actually permitted
to be formed, with his own knowledge, a society
of young girls between the ages of eight and
eighteen to meet at the parsonage, strangely resembling
those "circles" of our own time called s&eacute;ances,
for spiritualistic revelations. There can be no
doubt that the young girls were laboring under a
strong nervous and mental excitement, which was
encouraged rather than repressed by the means employed
by their spiritual director. Instead of treating
them as subjects of morbid delusion, Mr. Parris
regarded them as victims of external and diabolical
influence, and strangely enough this influence, on
the evidence of the children themselves, was supposed
to be exercised by some of the most pious
and respectable people of the community. As it
was those who opposed Mr. Parris, who fell under
the ban of suspicion, there is room to suspect the
reverent Mr. Parris with making a strong effort to
gratify his revenge.</p>

<p>Many a child has had its early life blighted and
its nerves shattered by a ghost-believing and ghost-story-telling
nurse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>No class of people is more superstitious in regard
to ghosts and witches than negroes. Whatever
fetich ideas may have been among the Indians
of the New World, many more were imbibed from
the Africans with whom they early came in
contact.</p>

<p>Old Tituba was a horrid-looking creature. If
ever there was a witch on earth, she was one, and
as she crouched in one corner, smoking her clay
pipe, her eyes closed, telling her weird stories to
the girls, no one can wonder that they were strangely
affected.</p>

<p>"Now, chillun, lem me tell ye, dat ef ebber a
witch catches ye, and pinches ye, and sticks pins
in ye, ye won't see 'em, ye won't see nobody, ye
won't see nuffin," said old Tituba.</p>

<p>"What should we do if a witch were to catch us,
Tituba?" asked Abigail Williams, the niece of Mr.
Parris.</p>

<p>"Dar but one thing to do, chile. Dat am to
burn de witch or hang 'em."</p>

<p>"Are there witches now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dar be plenty. I see 'em ob night. Doan
ye nebber see a black man in de night?"</p>

<p>The children were all silent, until one little girl,
whose imagination was very vivid, thought she had
seen a black man, once.</p>

<p>"When was it?" asked Abigail Williams.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"One night, when I waked out of my sleep, I
saw a great black something by my side."</p>

<p>The little blue eyes opened so wide and looked
with such earnestness on the assembled children,
that there could be no doubting her sincerity.</p>

<p>"Can we catch witches?" Abigail asked Tituba.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Many ways."</p>

<p>Then she proceeded to tell of the various charms
by which a witch might be detected, such as drawing
the picture of the person accused and stabbing
it with a knife of silver, or shooting it with a silver
bullet.</p>

<p>"Once, when a witch was in a churn," continued
Tituba, "and no butter would come, den de man,
he take some hot water an' pour it in de churn, an'
jist den dar come a loud noise like er gun, an' dey
see er cloud erbove de churn. Bye um bye, dat
cloud turned ter er woman's head an' et war an ole
woman wat lib in der neighborhood and war called
a witch."</p>

<p>"Is that true, Tituba?" asked one of the little
girls.</p>

<p>"It am so, fur er sartin sure fact, chile."</p>

<p>Nothing is more susceptible than a young imagination.
It can see whatever it wills, hear whatever
is desired, and like wax is ready to receive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
any impression one chooses to put on it. A child
can be made to believe it sees the most unnatural
things, and in a few days Tituba and John had
thoroughly convinced the children that they saw
spirits and witches in the air all about them.</p>

<p>One evening, a pretty young woman, not over
twenty-one or two, came to the parsonage, where
the witches and ghosts had been holding high revel.
She was a brunette with a dark keen eye and hair
of jet. Her face was lovely, save when distorted
by passion, and her form was faultless.</p>

<p>"Sarah Williams, where have you been, that we
have seen nothing of you for a fortnight?" asked
Mrs. Parris as the visitor entered the house.</p>

<p>"I have been to Boston, and but just came back
yesterday. What strange things have been transpiring
since I left?"</p>

<p>At this moment a door opened and Mr. Parris, a
tall, pale man, entered from his study. The new-comer,
without waiting for the pastor's wife to answer
her question, rose and, grasping the hand of
her spiritual adviser, cried:</p>

<p>"Mr. Parris, how pale you are! but then I cannot
wonder at it, when I consider all I have heard."</p>

<p>"What have you heard, Sarah?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have heard you are having trouble in your
congregation."</p>

<p>"Who told you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"The rumor has gone all over the country, even
reaching Boston. And they do say that the evil
spirits have visited Salem to defame you."</p>

<p>Mr. Parris pressed his thin lips so firmly that
the blood seemed to have utterly forsaken them,
and his cold gray eye was kindled with a subdued
fire, as he answered:</p>

<p>"I am far from insensible that at this extraordinary
time of the devil coming down in great wrath
upon us, there are too many tongues and hearts
thereby set on fire of hell."</p>

<p>"To whom can you trace your troubles?"</p>

<p>"To Goodwife Nurse," answered the pastor.
"It is that firebrand of hell who seeks to ruin me."</p>

<p>"I saw Goody Nurse," cried one of the smaller
children.</p>

<p>"When?" asked Mr. Parris.</p>

<p>"Last night."</p>

<p>The pastor, the visitor, and the wife exchanged
significant glances, and the father asked:</p>

<p>"Where did you see her?"</p>

<p>"She came with the black man to my bed."</p>

<p>"What did she do?"</p>

<p>"She asked me to sign the book."</p>

<p>"What book?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but it was a red book."</p>

<p>The anxious mother, in a fit of hysterics, seized
her child in her arms and cried:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no, no! don't you sign the book and sell
your immortal soul, child!" and she gave way to a
fit of weeping, which unnerved all the children,
who began to howl, as if they were beset by demons.
When the hubbub was at its height, the door to an
adjoining room opened, and Tituba and John stuck
their heads into the room.</p>

<p>"She am dar! she am dar!" cried old Tituba.
"I see her! I see dem bofe!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see um&mdash;see um bofe, Tituba," repeated
John.</p>

<p>"Who do you see?" asked the pastor.</p>

<p>"See de black man and Goody Nurse."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Dar."</p>

<p>They pointed along the floor, then up the wall
to the ceiling, where they both avowed that they
saw Goodwife Nurse and the black man, or demon,
dancing with their heels up and heads down.</p>

<p>The negro clapped his hands, patted his foot on
the floor and cried aloud:</p>

<p>"Doan yer see um, Marster? doan yer see um,
chillun?"</p>

<p>One little girl, who fixed her eyes on a certain
dark corner of the room, thought she could see a
shadow moving on the wall, but was not quite certain.
The pastor was overcome by the presence of
the prince of darkness in his own house, and, falling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
on his knees, began to pray. As a natural
result, when all minds were directed to one channel,
as they were by prayer, the superstitious feeling
which possessed them passed away, and the
household, which a few moments ago was on the
verge of hysteria, became more calm, and when all
rose from their knees, Mrs. Parris asked her visitor
to spend the evening with them.</p>

<p>"I fain would stay; but I dread the long walk
home."</p>

<p>"Samuel will accompany you, unless Charles
Stevens comes, as he promised. In case he should,
he can go with you."</p>

<p>At the mention of Charles Stevens, the young
woman's eyes grew brighter, and her face became
crimson.</p>

<p>"Sarah, have you not heard from your husband?"
asked the minister.</p>

<p>"No; he is dead."</p>

<p>"Did you never hear of the pinnace?"</p>

<p>"No; but it was no doubt lost."</p>

<p>"How long since he left?"</p>

<p>"A year. He went to New York, was seen to
leave that port, and has never been heard from."</p>

<p>"It is sad."</p>

<p>"Verily, it is," and Sarah tried hard to call up
a tear, and wiped her eyes with the corner of her
apron.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>John and Tituba had retired to their domain,
the kitchen, to conjure up more demons and plan
further mischief.</p>

<p>Mr. Parris could not keep his mind long from
the rebellious members of his flock. "I will be
avenged on them," he thought. "Verily, I will
be avenged for every pang they have made me
suffer."</p>

<p>He had forgotten the command, "Vengeance is
mine, I will repay, saith the Lord."</p>

<p>Sarah Williams proceeded to further delve into
the trouble with Mr. Parris and his church.</p>

<p>"Is Rebecca Nurse your enemy?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Verily, she is; so is her sister Goodwife
Corey."</p>

<p>"Why are they your enemies?"</p>

<p>"They want another pastor, and have done all
in their power to ruin me."</p>

<p>"Why do you endure it?" asked Sarah.</p>

<p>"How can I help myself? I retain my charge
and shall retain it, despite Goody Nurse."</p>

<p>At this the youngest child said:</p>

<p>"Goody Nurse was at church last Lord's day
with a yellow bird."</p>

<p>"A yellow bird?" cried all.</p>

<p>"Yes; I saw a yellow bird fly into the church
and light on her shoulder."</p>

<p>Tituba had told the poor deluded child that if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Goodwife Nurse were a witch, she would be accompanied
by a yellow bird.</p>

<p>"Surely you saw no yellow bird last Lord's
day."</p>

<p>"Verily, I did, and it came first and sat on her
shoulder, and then on her knee, and, while father
was preaching, it whispered in her ear."</p>

<p>"Could you hear what it said?" asked the pastor.</p>

<p>"No, for I was not near enough."</p>

<p>Then the pastor and his wife and visitor exchanged
glances. Foolishly credulous and blindly
superstitious, as well as prejudiced, their minds
were like the fallow ground ready to receive any
impression, however silly.</p>

<p>Before more could be said, there came a rap at
the door, and Charles Stevens, the lad who succored
the wounded stranger that had so mysteriously disappeared,
entered. Charles was almost a man, and
bid fair to make a fine-looking fellow. He was tall
and muscular, with bold gray eyes and a face open
and manly. He had lost none of his mirth, and
his merry whistle still shocked some of the staid
old Puritans.</p>

<p>As soon as Charles entered, the young widow
rose, all blushing, to greet him. She was not
more than one or two years his senior, and, being
still beautiful, there was a possibility of her entrapping
the youth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>The pastor greeted him warmly and assured him
that his visit was most opportune; but he regretted
very much that he had not come an hour
sooner.</p>

<p>"Wherefore would you have had me come an
hour sooner?" asked the merry Charles.</p>

<p>"That you might, with your own eyes, behold
some of the wonderful manifestations of the prince
of darkness."</p>

<p>With a laugh, Charles answered that such manifestations
were too common to merit much comment;
but as a matter of course he asked what the manifestations
were.</p>

<p>"An example of witchcraft."</p>

<p>At this Charles laughed, and Mr. Parris was
shocked at his scepticism.</p>

<p>"Wherefore do you laugh, unregenerated
youth?" cried the pastor.</p>

<p>"A witch! I believe there are no witches," he
answered.</p>

<p>"Would you believe your eyes, young sceptic?"</p>

<p>"I might even doubt my own eyes."</p>

<p>"Wherefore would you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing is more deceptive than sight; optical
delusions are common. Did you see a witch?"</p>

<p>"Not myself; but others did."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"John, Tituba and Ann Parris saw the witches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
dancing on the ceiling, with their feet up and their
heads down."</p>

<p>At this Charles Stevens again laughed and answered:</p>

<p>"Verily you are mad, Mr. Parris, to believe
what those lying negroes say. They have persuaded
the child into the belief that she sees strange
sights."</p>

<p>Mr. Parris became greatly excited and cried:</p>

<p>"The maid sees the shape of Goody Nurse and
the black man at night. They come and choke
her, to make her sign the book."</p>

<p>"What book?"</p>

<p>"The devil's book. Do you not remember some
time ago a stranger was at your house, who mysteriously
disappeared?" Of course Charles remembered.
He had never forgotten that mysterious
stranger, and often wondered what had been his
fate.</p>

<p>"The same shape appeared before John Louder
in the forest, where he had gone to stalk deer, and
asked him to sign the red book in which is recorded
the souls of the damned."</p>

<p>This was the frightful story told by Louder on
his return from the night's hunt, and many of the
credulous New Englanders believed him. Mr.
Parris, having become warmed up on his subject,
resumed:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Charles, Charles, shake off the hard yoke of
the devil. Where 'tis said, 'the whole world lies
in wickedness,' 'tis by some of the ancients rendered,
'the whole world lies in the devil.' The
devil is a prince, yea, the devil is a god unto all
the unregenerate, and, alas, there is a whole world
of them. Desolate sinner, consider what a horrid
lord it is you are enslaved unto, and oh, shake off
the slavery of such a lord."</p>

<p>Charles was unprepared for such a sermon, and
had no desire to be bored with it, yet he was left
without choice in the matter.</p>

<p>The young widow came to his relief and took
him off under her protection and soon made him
forget that he had ever been rebuked by the parson.
Certainly, he had never met a more agreeable person
than Sarah Williams. Her husband was a
brother of Mrs. Parris, and she wielded a great influence
in the minister's family. Gradually she
absorbed more and more of Charles Stevens' society,
telling him of her recent visit to Boston, and of the
latest news from England, inquiring about his
mother, and talking only on the subjects which
most interested him. He thought her a charming
woman.</p>

<p>The hour was late ere they knew it, and Puritanic
New England was an enemy to late hours.
Sarah declared she must go home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come again, Sarah," said Mrs. Parris.</p>

<p>"I will. Verily, I must go; but see, the moon
is down, how dark it is."</p>

<p>Charles was not slower to take the hint than a
young man of our own day. Humanity has been
the same since Eve first evinced her power over
Adam in the garden. Ever since, men have been
led by a pretty face often to their ruin. Charles,
in a bashful, awkward way, informed the young
widow that he was going the same road, and it
would not be much out of his way to accompany
her to her very door. Of course she was pleased,
and Charles and the young widow went away
together.</p>

<p>"Have you never learned the fate of your husband,
Sarah?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No; poor Samuel is dead," she answered.</p>

<p>"It is sad that you know not his fate. Was he
drowned at sea, killed by the Indians, or murdered
by the pirates?"</p>

<p>"I know not. I am very lonely now, Charles."</p>

<p>"I pity you."</p>

<p>"Do you?"</p>

<p>"Verily, I do."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Charles."</p>

<p>"Your parents are in Boston, are they not?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you intend to live always thus alone?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I trust not," and the darkness concealed
the sly glance which Sarah cast from her great dark
eyes on the unsuspecting youth at her side. The
conversation was next changed to Mr. Parris, his
quarrel with his flock, and the strange phenomenon
developing at his house.</p>

<p>"What think you of it, Charles?"</p>

<p>"It is a sham."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no! John, the negro man, is bewitched,
and has fits."</p>

<p>"A good flogging would very quickly bring him
out of his fits."</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the door of Sarah
Williams' house. She turned upon the youth and,
seizing his arm, in a voice trembling with emotion,
said:</p>

<p>"Charles, I beseech of you, as you love life and
happiness, do not say aught against Mr. Parris or
witchcraft. We stand on the brink of something
terrible, and no one knows what the end may be."</p>

<p>As Charles wended his way homeward, he pondered
over the strange words of Sarah Williams,
and asked himself:</p>

<p>"What does she mean?"</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The incidents narrated in this chapter were gathered
from Cotton Mather's "Invisible World," and legends current
at the time. Strange as it may seem, these narratives
were believed, and some are from sworn testimony in court.</p></div>

<p>Most people are superstitious. In fact, we
might put it stronger and say, all people are superstitious.
Superstition is natural, and so long as
there are great mysteries unrevealed to man, there
will be superstition. So long as the great mysteries
of life and death and a future existence are shrouded
in the unknown, there will be believers in the supernatural.
So long as there are powers and forces
not understood, they will be attributed to unknown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
or unnatural causes. Most people are unwilling to
admit, even to themselves, that they are superstitious,
yet somewhere in their nature will be found
a belief in some odd and ludicrous superstition.
Many have a dread of the unlucky number; some
will not commence a journey on Friday; they feel
better when they have seen the new moon over
their right shoulder, and when the matter is well
sifted, we find lurking about all a strange, inexplicable
superstition.</p>

<p>Two hundred years ago, superstition was far
more prevalent than at present, and some of the
wisest and best of that day possessed the oddest
and most unreasonable opinions.</p>

<p>A few evenings after the incidents narrated in
the foregoing chapter, Charles Stevens, who had
been all day on a hunt, at night found himself near
an old deserted house, four or five miles from town.
The house had been built by some Puritans, years
before, and the family which had lived in it were
murdered by Indians. The house was currently
reported at the village to be haunted; but Charles,
who was not a believer in ghosts, resolved to pass
the night there, in preference to braving a threatening
thunderstorm.</p>

<p>His negro man Pete was with him, and when
he told Pete to gather up some dry wood, the
darkey, with eyes protruding from his head, asked:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Massa Charles, am ye gwine to stay heah all
night?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Pete, why not? A storm is coming,
and we could not reach home in such a tempest."</p>

<p>"But dis house am haunted."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, Pete. Get the wood, and don't
let such foolish notions as ghosts enter your
mind."</p>

<p>Pete reluctantly obeyed, and Charles went into
the house where was an old lamp which had been
left there by hunters. It was nearly full of oil,
and he lighted it by aid of his flint and steel.</p>

<p>Some rude benches and three-legged stools constituted
the furniture. Pete, finding that nothing
could induce his master to go on, gathered a quantity
of dry wood before the rain began to fall, and
started a fire.</p>

<p>The single lamp, burning dimly on the mantel,
gave a weird ghost-like gleam, and Pete shuddered
as he glanced into the dark corners and the black
attic above, from whence his fervid imagination
conjured up lost spirits, ghosts and goblins ready
to seize him by the hair.</p>

<p>Just as the first great rain-drops began to fall on
the old weather-beaten roof of the deserted house,
they heard the rapid tramp of feet without. Pete
uttered a horrified yell and sprang into the chimney,
where he was trying to start a fire. Charles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
told him to refrain from his silly conduct and went
to the door to see who their visitors were.</p>

<p>"Charles, Charles, is it you?" cried a voice
which he recognized as John Louder. "We saw
the light within and determined to seek shelter."</p>

<p>Louder was accompanied by his neighbors Bly
and Gray, all carrying guns and some small game
in their hands.</p>

<p>"You have been in the forest to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, with ill luck, too. Marry! I trow,
neighbors, we will have a tempest," cried Louder,
as he and his companions entered the old house.
A burst of thunder shook the earth; the wild winds
raged about the house, making the rickety old
structure creak and groan, while the air about
seemed on fire. For a moment all were awed to
silence; then Charles said:</p>

<p>"It will soon pass. The rain will soon drown
it."</p>

<p>"Have you but just come?" asked Louder.</p>

<p>"Just arrived."</p>

<p>"I would not, under other circumstances, put up
in such a place as this; but it is better than the
storm raging without."</p>

<p>The hunters, thankful for even such poor shelter,
skinned some squirrels, and toasted them before
the glowing fire, which Pete had built. Supper
over, they drew the benches close about the fire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
and while they listened to the raging storm without,
conversed on the mysteries of that invisible
world, which has always formed an interesting
theme for the children of Adam.</p>

<p>"Charles Stevens, only a few years ago, you
harbored at your house a wizard," said Louder.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens was half amused and half indignant.
He began to expostulate with Louder, when
the latter said:</p>

<p>"Nay, nay; I charge you not with bartering
with the devil; but list to me. On the selfsame
day you found the stranger wounded at the road-side
near the spring, we three had been hunting
among the hills for deer. Some one had bewitched
my gun. I know it, for when I fired, the bullet,
which never failed on other occasions to go straight
to the mark, went astray. All day long that mysterious
stranger had followed us, grievously tormenting
us and leading astray our shots, until I
loaded my piece with a sixpence and fired at a large
fat buck which strutted temptingly before me.
Had you probed his wound I trow you would have
found my sixpence buried in his side."</p>

<p>At this, the negro, who was crouched in a corner,
groaned in agony, while Charles was inclined to
treat the matter lightly. Louder related how, while
at the lake in the wood, he had been visited by
this mysterious apparition, who offered him a book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
to sign, adding that he knew at once that his tormentor
was a wizard or the Devil, that his eyes
were in an instant changed to fire, and sulphurous
smoke issued from his nostrils.</p>

<p>"Can you ask me if I believe my own eyes and
my own ears?" concluded Louder. "Those are
truths, and had I signed his book, I would have
been tormented by fiends and my soul forever lost."</p>

<p>"They do say the people are ready to cry out on
Goody Nurse," put in Bly.</p>

<p>"Goody Nurse! surely not," answered Charles.
"She is one of the best women I know. She is
kind, good and gentle with all."</p>

<p>"Verily, so is Satan, until he has his clutches
upon you. Goody Nurse is a witch."</p>

<p>"Beware, John Louder, how you malign such
as she," said Charles, growing serious. "Have the
proof before you assert."</p>

<p>"I know whereof I speak," declared John
Louder. "About five or six months ago, one morning
about sunrise, I was in my chamber assaulted
by the shape of Goody Nurse, which looked on me,
grinned at me, and very much hurt me with a blow
on the side of my head. That selfsame day, about
noon, the same shape walked in the room where I
was, and an apple strangely flew out of my hand,
into the lap of my wife, six or eight feet from me.
Can you deny such evidences as this?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have seen her," put in John Bly, "and once
when her shape did assail me, I struck at her with
my cane, and she cried out that I had torn her
coat."</p>

<p>Samuel Gray stated that he had been tormented
with spectres and spirits. All this was agony to
the horrified negro, who, crouching in one corner,
shivered with dread, while his eyes wildly rolled in
agony.</p>

<p>"Once a shape appeared to me and did tempt me
to sign a book which I refused to do, and the shape
whipped me with iron rods to compel me thereunto."</p>

<p>"Did you know the witch?" asked Charles.</p>

<p>"Verily, I did."</p>

<p>"Who was it?"</p>

<p>"One Bridget Bishop. I afterward saw her at
a general meeting of witches in a field, where they
all partook of a diabolical sacrament, not of bread
and wine, but of the flesh and blood of murdered
people."</p>

<p>At this the negro groaned and crouched closer
to the chimney jamb. The storm roared without,
and the rain fell with a steady pouring sound, as
the superstitious hunters filled their pipes and
gathered closer about the fire.</p>

<p>"There is no need to deny longer that witches
exist," said John Louder. "I have seen enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
of them to convince me beyond question that there
are witches. Ann Durent one day left her infant,
William Durent with Amy Dunny, a woman who
has since been known to be a witch. Though
Dunny was an old woman, she afterward confessed
she had given suck to the child, whereat Durent
was displeased and Dunny went away with discontent
and menaces.</p>

<p>"The night after, the child fell into strange and
sad fits, wherein it continued for divers weeks.
One doctor Jacob, who knew something of witches,
advised her to hang up the child's blanket in the
chimney corner all day, and at night, when she
went to put the child into it, if she found anything
in it, then to throw it without fear into the fire.
Accordingly at night when she took down the
blanket, there fell out of it a great toad, which
hopped up and down the hearth, uttering strange
cries. A boy caught it, and held it in the fire with
the tongs, where it made a horrible noise, and
flashed like gunpowder, with a report like that of
a pistol. Whereupon the toad was seen no more.
The next day a kinswoman of Dunny said she was
grievously scorched with the fire, and on going to
the house it was found to be even so. After the
burning of the toad, the child recovered."</p>

<p>"I did not believe in witchcraft at first," remarked
Samuel Gray, by way of preface to some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
weird account of his own; "but I cannot doubt
my senses. I had been to Boston on business for
the parson and, being belated, was riding along the
road homeward. I had just reached the old Plaistowe
field, when I suddenly discovered a long black
something, like a monster cat or panther, running
along the fence at my side. I was seized of some
strange power and despite my will was forced to
wink my eyes. If I closed my eyes but for a
second, the black object was back at the point
where it started from and ran along again, until I
closed my eyes, when it appeared where I had first
seen it. My horse became affrighted and ran away
with me."</p>

<p>John Bly knocked the ashes from his pipe and
began:</p>

<p>"I have an uncle in Virginia, who was sorely
tried by witches. One witch in the neighborhood,
especially, did grievously torment him. He would
go to his door and see his field full of cattle; but
on entering the field itself, no cattle were to be
seen. Knowing full well that he was bewitched,
he loaded his gun with a silver bullet, and one day
fired at a large white cow. Instantly every beast
disappeared, and he saw an old woman over the
hill limping as if in pain. It was the suspected
witch, whom he had shot in the leg. She did
not bother him any more; but another witch used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
to come at night and ride him. She would shake
a witch bridle over his head, utter some incantation
and my uncle would be turned into a horse, and
she would ride him hard until morning. Then she
would bring him home, remove the spell, and he
would be asleep in bed at dawn. One night he
was thus ridden to a witch ball and tied to a tree.
He rubbed his head against the tree until he got the
bridle off, the spell was broken and he was once
more a man. He took the enchanted bridle and
laid in wait for the witch. As she emerged from
the door, he seized her, shook the bridle over her
head, repeated the words she had used, and instantly
she was changed into a fine gray mare. He
mounted her and rode her furiously, out of revenge,
for many miles to a blacksmith, where he alighted
and, awaking the smith, had him shoe the mare at
once. Then he rode her nearly home, when he
turned her loose.</p>

<p>"Next morning he went to the home of his
neighbor, whose wife he suspected of being the
witch, and inquired after the health of the family.</p>

<p>"'My wife is ill,' answered the head of the house.</p>

<p>"'What ails her?'</p>

<p>"'Alas, I know not.'</p>

<p>"My uncle went into the room where the woman
lay in bed suffering greatly.</p>

<p>"'Are you very ill?' my uncle asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I am sick almost unto death,' the woman answered.</p>

<p>"'Let me hold your hand and see if you have a
fever.'</p>

<p>"'No, no, no!' and she sought to hide her hands
under the cover; but my uncle was a resolute man,
and he seized her hand and drew it from beneath
the cover, and behold, a horseshoe was nailed unto
it. On each hand and each foot there was nailed
a shoe which the smith at the trial swore he had
put on the gray mare the night before."</p>

<p>The negro groaned at the conclusion of the narrative,
and his face was so expressive of agony,
that it formed a comical picture, exciting the
laughter of Charles Stevens, and Bly supposing
that he was skeptical of the story he had told
said:</p>

<p>"Do you doubt the truth of my narrative, my
merry fellow? Perchance you may some day feel
the clutches of a witch upon you, then, pray God,
beware."</p>

<p>"These are matters of too serious moment to excite
one to laughter," put in Mr. Gray, solemnly.
"Since the devil is come down in great wrath upon
us, let us not in our great wrath against one another
provide a lodging for him."</p>

<p>Charles, the reckless, merry youth, treated the
matter as it would be treated at the present day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"You need not deride the idea of witches changing
people to horses," said John Louder, who, according
to accounts given of him, by Cotton Mather,
was either an accomplished liar or a man possessing
a vivid imagination.</p>

<p>"Have you ever had any personal experience?"
asked Charles.</p>

<p>"Indeed I have."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"Goody Nurse does such things; but she has
ever been too shrewd to be caught as was the
witch in Virginia."</p>

<p>"Goody Nurse! For shame on you, Mr. Louder,
to accuse that good, righteous woman with offences
as heinous as having familiar spirits."</p>

<p>With a solemnity so earnest that sincerity could
scarcely be doubted, John Louder remarked:</p>

<p>"Glad should I be, if I had never known the
name of this woman, or never had this occasion to
mention so much as her name. Goody Nurse is
the most base of all God's creatures, for she takes
unto herself a seeming holiness."</p>

<p>"What hath she done?"</p>

<p>"Listen and I will tell you. She hath grievously
afflicted my children. At night her shape appears
to them accompanied by a black man. She hath
power to change her own form into an animal, a
bird or insect at will. Once my little girl was attacked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
by a large black cat, which she recognized
as Goody Nurse.</p>

<p>"Not only does she afflict my children; but my
cattle, my gun and myself have been bewitched by
her."</p>

<p>John Louder here paused and, refilling his pipe,
lighted it, took a few whiffs to get it going and resumed:</p>

<p>"If you will listen to what I say, I will tell you
of a certain incident which befell me last summer.
One night I had retired early to rest, for, having
been in the fields all day, I was somewhat weary.
I fell asleep and was dreaming of pleasant forests,
running brooks, green meadows, thrift and plenty,
when suddenly methought I heard a voice calling
unto me.</p>

<p>"'John Louder! John Louder!' it seemed to say.</p>

<p>"I started up from my pillow and sat on the
side of my bed. The day had been very hot, the
night was still warm, and the window had been left
open, that the good south breeze might refresh my
heated face. Suddenly in through that window
came a great black object. I could see the eyes
like blue flames, the face with a hideous grin,
great sharp ears and short horns on top. He had
bat-like wings, a tail, and on one foot was a cloven
hoof.</p>

<p>"I was too much affrighted to speak; but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
shape motioned me to rise. I did so. An instant
later, lo, a second shape appeared, and this was
Rebecca Nurse. They did not ask me to sign the
book, this time, for I had declined so often to do
so, that they thought it little need.</p>

<p>"'Come!' said Goody Nurse. I rose and followed,
I own, for I was under some strange spell.</p>

<p>"We got out of the house, I know not how, and
I saw a great many people waiting. Some were
on the ground, and some were in the air. All
were on broomsticks.</p>

<p>"'Come, John Louder, mount behind me,' said
Rebecca Nurse, and I was compelled to get behind
her."</p>

<p>"What was she riding?" Charles asked.</p>

<p>"A broomstick."</p>

<p>Charles, by an effort, restrained the laughter,
which the answer had so nearly created, and John
Louder resumed:</p>

<p>"She uttered a strange, terrible cry, and we all
rose in the air on the broomsticks and away we
sped like birds. I was in constant fear lest I
should fall and be dashed to death on the ground.
I clung to her, and she, uttering strange screeches
and cries, sped on like a bird through the air. Her
broomstick rose and fell at her command.</p>

<p>"At last we descended to a valley, and all the
witches save Goody Nurse disappeared. Here I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
soon learned that, instead of riding, I was to be
ridden. By a few magic words, my face became
elongated, my body grew, my hands and feet became
hoofs, my body was covered
with hair, I had a mane and tail,
and I was a horse, with a
saddle on my back, and a bit in
my mouth. Mounting me, the
old witch cried:</p>

<p>"'Be going,
Johnnie, I will
give you sore
bones ere the cock crows.'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 614px;">

title="&quot;We all rose in the air on broomsticks.&quot;" />
</div>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">"We all rose in the air on broomsticks."</span></p>

<p>"I was goaded to desperation.
I ran, I leaped, I
sprang from precipices so
high, that, had I not been held up by the spirits of
the air, I must have been dashed to death on the
rocks below. I was agonized, and I wanted to
die.</p>

<p>"At last we came to a valley and a house, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
I recognized as the old Ames Meeting House. Here
a number of poor wretches like myself who had
been changed to beasts and ridden almost to death,
were tied up. Some of them were horses, some
were bulls, and one had been changed to a ram,
another to an ostrich. I was tied to a tree so near
to the door of the house, that I could see within.</p>

<p>"Verily, it was such a sight as I pray God I may
never witness again. There were the witches at
their infernal feast. The liver and lungs, torn warm
and bleeding from some helpless wretch, lay on the
table. They partook of the food, also the diabolical
sacrament, and then commenced their dance. I
saw them dancing with their feet up to the ceiling
and their heads hanging down.</p>

<p>"In my agony of spirit, I seized the tree nearest
me in my mouth, and bit it so hard that I broke
out the tooth," and here the narrator exhibited his
teeth, one of the front ones being gone. "You
see the tooth is missing. A week later I went to
the Ames Meeting House and found the tooth sticking
in the tree.</p>

<p>"After they had kept up their infernal dance
for an hour, Goody Nurse again appeared and,
mounting on my back, did ride me most grievously
hard over the hills and plains, until we came to my
home. Then she suddenly slipped from my back
and hurled me head first through the window,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
where I fell in my own shape by the side of the
bed."</p>

<p>Charles Stevens, feeling assured that he had a
solution to the marvellous story, said:</p>

<p>"It was no doubt a frightful dream, which to
you seemed real."</p>

<p>"Dream, was it?" cried Louder. "I sprang to
my feet, ran to the window, and, sure as I am a
white man, there was Goody Nurse soaring away
through the air on a broomstick."</p>

<p>When he had finished his story, the horrified
group shuddered and gathered closer about the fire
which had burned low on the hearth. Pete tried
to lay on a stick with his trembling hand, but was
not equal to the task. The lamp-wick burned low in
its socket, flickered and threatened to go out, while
the storm without howled with increasing fury, the
rain beat against the side of the house, and the
thunder crashed overhead.</p>

<p>A shuddering silence seemed to have seized upon
the group, and they sat watching the flickering
lamp and smouldering fire, when suddenly all were
roused by a loud rapping at the door. The entire
group started up in alarm, the negro howled, and
Bly gasped:</p>

<p>"God save us!"</p>

<p>"The whole armor of God shield us against the
witches," groaned John Louder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Heaven help us now!" whispered Gray.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens, though scarcely more than a
youth, was the most self-possessed of all. He rose
and opened the door. A blinding flash revealed a
pair of horses with drooping heads in the rain and
storm, while a man and young girl, the late riders
of the horses, stood at the door holding the reins.</p>

<p>As soon as the door was opened, the man, holding
the little maiden's hand in his own, stepped
into the house to be out of the gust of wind and
rain.</p>

<p>"We are belated travellers, kind sir, and seek
shelter from the storm," the stranger began.</p>

<p>At sound of his voice, John Louder sprang to
his feet, and, seizing the lamp, held it close to
the man's face. Starting back with a yell, he
cried:</p>

<p>"Away! wizard, devil, away! You are he who
offered the book to me. Away! away! or I will
slay you!"</p>

<p>The startled stranger answered:</p>

<p>"I never saw you before."</p>

<p>John Louder insisted that he was the evil one
who had met him at the lake while he was stalking
the deer, and had offered him the book to sign.</p>

<p>"I never saw you before in my life," the
stranger answered, his theatrical tones making a
strange impression on the superstitious Louder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
He read in his face the look of a demon, and continued
to cry:</p>

<p>"You must, you shall go away! Prince of darkness,
back into the storm which your powers
created!"</p>

<p>Charles Stevens was too much amazed to speak
for some moments, for, by the combined aid of the
lamp and firelight, he saw before him the very
features of the man whom he had found wounded
and almost dying at the spring. The wanderer
turned his sad and handsome face to the youth and
asked:</p>

<p>"Can you take us to shelter?"</p>

<p>"I did once, and will again."</p>

<p>"You did once? Truly you mistake, for I never
saw you before. My child will perish in this
storm."</p>

<p>"It is five miles to my house; but if you will
come with me I will show you the way."</p>

<p>They tried to dissuade Charles from going out
into the driving storm; but he was not moved by
their entreaties. He only saw the young maiden's
pale, sweet face and appealing blue eyes, and he
set off with the two through the storm, which beat
about them so that they were quite wet to the skin
when the house of widow Stevens was reached.
The man and the maid were given beds and dry
clothing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning, Charles asked the stranger:</p>

<p>"Are you not the man who came here in 1684,
wounded?"</p>

<p>"I am not. I was never here before. What is
your name?"</p>

<p>"Charles Stevens."</p>

<p>"Have you relatives in Boston?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my grandfather, Mathew Stevens, who
was a Spaniard by birth and called Mattheo Estevan,
died in Boston twenty years ago, and I have
uncles, aunts and cousins living there."</p>

<p>"Have you relatives in Virginia?"</p>

<p>"I have cousins."</p>

<p>"Is one Robert Stevens?"</p>

<p>"He is."</p>

<p>"I know him, he befriended me and sent me
here."</p>

<p>Then the stranger told how he had been an indented
slave in Virginia, and escaped from a cruel
master through the aid of Robert Stevens.</p>

<p>The strangers were George Waters and his
daughter Cora.</p>

<p>The Stevens family was growing with the colonies.
Of the descendants of Mathew Stevens who
came to New Plymouth in the <i>Mayflower</i>, there
were many living in Boston, New York, Salem,
Rhode Island and Connecticut. The family,
widely scattered as its members were, never lost
track of each other. They knew all their relatives
in Virginia, Maryland and Carolinia.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens, but a youth, was on a visit to
Connecticut, when an event transpired, which has
since become historical. An aunt of Charles
Stevens was the wife of a certain Captain Wadsworth,
and Charles was visiting at this aunt's house
when the incident happened.</p>

<p>As the student of American history doubtless
knows, the tyrannical Governor Andros of New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
York, claimed dominion over all that scope of
country denominated as the New Netherland, a
very indefinite term applied to a great scope of
country extending from Maryland to the Connecticut
River, to which point Andros claimed jurisdiction.</p>

<p>As early as 1675, he went to the mouth of the
Connecticut River with a small naval force, to assert
his authority. Captain Bull, the commander
of a small garrison at Saybrook, permitted him to
land; but when the governor began to read his commission,
Bull ordered him to be silent. Andros
was compelled to yield to the bold spirit and superior
military power of Captain Bull, and in a
towering passion he returned to New York, flinging
curses and threats behind him at the people of
Connecticut in general and Captain Bull in particular.</p>

<p>More than a dozen years had passed since Andros
had been humiliated by Connecticut, and,
despite his anathemas, the colony quietly pursued
the even tenor of its way. At the end of that
period, a most exciting incident occurred at Hartford,
during the visit of Charles Stevens to that city.
This historical incident has about it all the rosy
hues of romance. On the very day of the arrival
of Charles Stevens at Hartford, while he was talking
with Captain Wadsworth, his aunt's husband,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
a member of the colonial assembly suddenly entered
the house, his face flushed with excitement.</p>

<p>"What has happened, Mr. Prince?" Wadsworth
asked, for he could see that the man was greatly
excited.</p>

<p>"Governor Andros has come again," gasped Mr.
Prince.</p>

<p>"Why should that alarm us? The fellow,
though given to boasting, is not dangerous, or liable
to put his threats into execution."</p>

<p>"But he has grown dangerous!" declared Mr.
Prince. "The liberties of the colony are involved.
Andros appears as a usurper of authority&mdash;the
willing instrument of King James the second, who,
it seems, has determined to hold absolute rule over
all New England."</p>

<p>Captain Wadsworth became a little uneasy,
though he was still inclined to treat the matter
lightly. Mr. Prince, to convince him of the danger
they were in, continued:</p>

<p>"You remember that on his arrival in New York
as governor of New Netherland, he demanded the
surrender of all the colonial charters into his hands."</p>

<p>"I remember such an order, and furthermore
that all the colonies complied with his infamous
demand save Connecticut. We have stubbornly
refused to yield our charter voluntarily, for it is
the guardian of our political rights."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is true, Captain Wadsworth," continued
Mr. Prince, "and, to subdue our stubbornness,
this viceroy has come to Hartford with sixty armed
men, to demand the surrender of the charter in
person."</p>

<p>Captain Wadsworth bounded to his feet in a rage
and, placing his hand on the hilt of his sword, declared:</p>

<p>"He shall not have it!"</p>

<p>Arriving at Hartford on the 31st of October,
1687, Andros found the general assembly in session
in the meeting-house. The members received
him with the courtesy due to his rank. Before
that body, with armed men at his back, he demanded
a formal surrender of the precious charter
into his hands.</p>

<p>The members of the assembly were alarmed and
amazed at his request.</p>

<p>The day was well nigh spent, when he arrived,
and the members were engaged in a heated debate
on a subject of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>"Wait until the discussion is ended, and then
we will listen to you, governor," the president of
the assembly answered to the demand of Andros.</p>

<p>"I have come for the charter, and I will
have it!" said Andros, in his haughty, imperious
manner.</p>

<p>He consented, however, to await the discussion;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
but as soon as it was ended, he declared that he
would have the charter.</p>

<p>Captain Wadsworth chanced to be at his house
on the arrival of Andros, and, as everybody had
the most implicit confidence in the captain's good
sense, a member was despatched for him, as has
been stated.</p>

<p>After the captain had taken two or three turns
across the room, he paused and asked:</p>

<p>"What is the assembly doing?"</p>

<p>"Engaged in a debate."</p>

<p>"And will he wait until it has ended?"</p>

<p>"He has promised to do so."</p>

<p>"Hasten back, Mr. Prince, and whisper in the
ears of every member to prolong the debate. It
will give us time. I am going to do something
desperate. Tell them to discuss any side and every
side of the question at issue, and have your longest
speech-makers do their best&mdash;talk on anything and
everything whether to the point or against it, so
that they kill time until night."</p>

<p>Mr. Prince fixed his amazed eyes on the captain's
face and read there a desperate determination.</p>

<p>"Captain," he began.</p>

<p>"I know what you would say, Mr. Prince; but
it is needless to waste words; my resolution is
formed, and I am going to save our charter or perish
in the attempt."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope you will not endanger your own life&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Prince, our liberties are in danger, and
there is no time to think of life. Hasten back to
the assembly and I will follow in a few moments."</p>

<p>Mr. Prince bowed and hastily returned to the
house where the assembly was in session. As soon
as he was gone, Charles Stevens said:</p>

<p>"Uncle, something terrible is going to happen,
I know from your look and words. Won't you
let me go with you?"</p>

<p>Captain Wadsworth fixed his eyes on the youth
and answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, Charles, you will answer."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Are you willing to help us?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Then you can put out the lights."</p>

<p>"What lights?"</p>

<p>"At the proper time, put out the lights in the assembly;
but wait; I will go and muster the train-bands,
and have them at hand to prevent the governor's
soldiers from injuring the members of the
general assembly."</p>

<p>Captain Wadsworth went out, and on his way
looked into the State-house where everything was
going as well as he could have wished. He found
the debaters cudgelling their brains for something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
to say to the point or against it. Never
did debaters take greater interest in a minor subject.</p>

<p>He summoned his train-bands to assemble at sunset.
This done, he went home and found Charles
eagerly waiting.</p>

<p>"Charles, you see the soldiers of Governor Andros
at the State-house?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"They are sent to take our liberties. My train-bands
have their eyes on them."</p>

<p>"What do you intend doing, uncle? Will you
fight them?"</p>

<p>"Not unless they force it. We have no wish to
shed their blood. Listen; the charter is to be
brought to the assembly in the same mahogany box
in which Charles II. sent it to Governor Winthrop.
When it is laid on the table, the lights are to be
snuffed out. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Can you do it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing is easier."</p>

<p>"Remember, the work must be done right at the
time, not too soon, nor too late."</p>

<p>"I will do it at the exact moment, uncle. Have
no fear on that score."</p>

<p>The sun was setting, and the captain said:</p>

<p>"Come, Charles, let us hasten to the assembly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Look well at the setting sun, you may not live to
see it rise."</p>

<p>Charles Stevens smiled and answered:</p>

<p>"You do not expect me to be a coward?"</p>

<p>"By no means; but I want you to be fully impressed
with the seriousness of your mission."</p>

<p>They went to the general assembly at the meeting-house,
where they found everything in the utmost
confusion. The debate was at a white heat.</p>

<p>"Take your place, Charles, and be prepared to
do your part," whispered Captain Wadsworth.</p>

<p>Charles got as close to the long table used by the
secretaries as possible, without attracting special
attention.</p>

<p>The discussion went on, darkness came and four
lighted candles were placed on the table, and two
set on a shelf on the wall. Those two candles on
the wall were a great annoyance to Charles until he
saw a man stationed near them.</p>

<p>Time passed on, and darkness had enveloped the
earth. The debate was drawing to a close, or, in
fact, had gone as far as it could, without arousing
the suspicion of Governor Andros. When it ended,
the governor of New York declared:</p>

<p>"I have waited as long as I will. I demand the
charter at once. As governor of New York, this
being a part of my dominion, I will have it."</p>

<p>"Wait&mdash;&mdash;" began the president.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Charles Stevens, at one sweep, snuffed out every candle on the table.</span></p>

<p>"No; already I have waited too long. Bring it
at once."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>There have been so many stories told of the
Charter Oak that the author here feels justified in
stepping aside from the narrative to quote from the
journal for June 15, 1687, the following entry:</p>

<p>"Sundry of the court, desiring that the patent
or charter might be brought into the court, the secretary
sent for it, and informed the governor and
court that he had the charter, and showed it to the
court, and the governor bid him put it into the box
again, and lay it on the table, and leave the key in
the box, which he did, forthwith."</p>

<p>Affairs had proceeded to this point, when Charles
Stevens, who had crept quite close to the table,
with a long stick, at one sweep, snuffed out every
candle on the table.</p>

<p>"Treason! treason!" cried Andros, and at this
moment the two remaining candles on the wall
were extinguished.</p>

<p>"Lights! lights!" cried a voice, and at the same
moment, Andros shouted:</p>

<p>"The boy did it! kill the boy and seize the box!"
His hand was outstretched to take the box from the
table, when the same stick which had extinguished
the lights gave his knuckles such a rap that he uttered
a yell of pain.  Though the lights were extinguished,
through the windows the faint starlight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
dimly illuminated the scene. Charles Stevens saw
the outline of his uncle, who seized the box and
hurried with it from the meeting-house.</p>

<p>He followed him as rapidly as he could. A
terrible uproar and confusion inside attracted the
attention of everybody, so Captain Wadsworth escaped
without being noticed, with the precious document
under his arm. The youth was close behind
him and, when they were outside, seized his arm.</p>

<p>"Unhand me!" cried Captain Wadsworth,
snatching his sword from its sheath.</p>

<p>"Uncle!"</p>

<p>"Charles, it is you? Marry! boy, have a care
how you approach me. Why! I was about to run
you through."</p>

<p>"Have you got it?"</p>

<p>"Whist! Charles, the governor's soldiers are
near. They may hear you."</p>

<p>"They have enough to do in there," answered
the boy, pointing toward the meeting-house, in
which pandemonium seemed to reign.</p>

<p>The voice of Governor Andros could be heard
loud above the others calling to the troops to come
to his aid. The soldiers began to crowd about the
house, when, at a signal from Captain Wadsworth,
the train-bands came on the scene and prepared to
grapple with the soldiers. A bloody fight seemed
inevitable; but Governor Andros, who was a coward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
as well as tyrant, at sign of danger, begged
peace.</p>

<p>"Lights! Light the candles!" he cried, "and
we will have peace." When the candles were relighted,
the members were seen seated about the
table in perfect order; but the charter could nowhere
be seen. For a few moments, the outwitted
governor stood glaring at first one and then the
other of the assembly. His passion choked him
to silence at first; but as soon as he partially recovered
his self-possession, he demanded:</p>

<p>"Where is the charter?" No one answered,
and, with bosom swelling with indignation at being
cheated by a device of the shrewd members of
the assembly, he threatened to have them arrested.</p>

<p>"Governor Andros, we dispute your authority
here, and have disputed it before," said a member
of the assembly. "You have your soldiers at the
door and we have the train-bands of Connecticut
ready to defend us against violence."</p>

<p>"Who of you has the charter?"</p>

<p>"I have not," answered one.</p>

<p>"Nor I."</p>

<p>"Nor I," answered each and every one.</p>

<p>"It was the boy," cried the enraged governor.
"I saw him; he struck my hand in the dark; yet
I knew it was he. Where is he? Whose son is
he?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Every member of the assembly shook their heads.</p>

<p>"We do not know him. He does not live in
Connecticut."</p>

<p>"Where does he live?"</p>

<p>"He is from Massachusetts and beyond even the
claimed bounds of your jurisdiction."</p>

<p>"So this is another trick. You have imported
one from a distant colony to steal the charter," the
indignant governor cried.</p>

<p>"We resent your insult!" cried an officer of the
assembly. "The imputation is false!"</p>

<p>A scene far more stormy than any which had
preceded it followed. The governor threatened the
colony with the fury of his vengeance, and vowed
he would report them to the king as in open rebellion
against his authority. The colonists were
shrewd and firm, and though some made very sarcastic
answers to the governor's charges, they were,
in the main, quite respectful.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Captain Wadsworth and his wife's
nephew, having the charter, hurried through the
crowd, which opened for them to pass and closed
behind them. Once in the street they hastened
away at a rapid pace.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with it?" Charles
asked.</p>

<p>"Place it where it cannot be found by the
tyrants," said the gallant captain. "There is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
venerable oak with a hollow in it. In this cavity
we will hide the charter, and none but you and
I will know where it is. You can return to Salem,
beyond reach of Governor Andros, and, as for me,
he can flay me alive before I will reveal the hiding-place."</p>

<p>They had reached the outskirts of the village
and paused beneath the wide-spreading branches of
a great oak tree. The wind, sighing through the
branches, seemed to
the liberty-adoring
Wadsworth to be
whispering of freedom.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 627px;">
<img src="images/charter.jpg" width="627" height="567" alt="The Charter Oak." title="The Charter Oak." />
</div>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">The Charter Oak.</span></p>

<p>"Stand a little way
off, Charles," commanded
the captain.
"And watch to see
that no one is observing me."</p>

<p>Then, while Charles
stood as sentry, he went to the tree and put the
charter in the hollow. Little did the captain or
his youthful assistant dream that their simple act
would make the old tree historic.</p>

<p>As long as American students shall study the
history of their country, will "The Charter Oak"
be famous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>That same night Charles Stevens, fearing the
wrath of Governor Andros, set out for his home at
Salem. The tree in which the document was hidden
was ever afterward known as the "Charter Oak."
It remained vigorous, bearing fruit every year until
a little after midnight, August, 1856, when it was
prostrated by a heavy storm of wind. It stood in
a vacant lot on the south side of Charter Street, a
few rods from Main Street, in the city of Hartford.</p>

<p>When, in 1687, Andros demanded the surrender
of the colonial charters, the inhabitants of Rhode
Island instantly yielded. When the order for the
seizure of the charters was first made known, the
assembly of Rhode Island sent a most loyal address
to the king saying:</p>

<p>"We humbly prostrate ourselves, our privileges,
our all, at the gracious feet of your majesty, with an
entire resolution to serve you with faithful hearts."</p>

<p>Andros therefore found no opposition in the little
colony. Within a month after his arrival at Boston,
he proceeded to Rhode Island, where he was
graciously received. He formally dissolved the
assembly, broke the seal of the colony, which bore
the figure of an anchor, and the word Hope, admitted
five of the inhabitants into his legislative
council, and assumed the functions of governor;
but he did not take away the parchment on which
the charter was written. The people of Rhode<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Island were restive under the petty tyranny of Andros,
and when they heard of the imprisonment of
the despot at Boston, in 1689, they assembled at
Newport, resumed popular government under the
old charter, and began a new independent political
career. From that time, until the enforced union
of the colonies for mutual defence, at the breaking
out of the French and Indian war, the inhabitants
of Rhode Island bore their share in the defensive
efforts, especially when the hostile savages hung
along the frontiers of New York like an ill-omened
cloud. The history of that commonwealth is identified
with that of all New England, from the beginning
of King William's war, soon after, to the expulsion
of Andros.</p>

<p>Six years after the charter was hidden in the oak,
Andros was succeeded by Governor Fletcher who
made an attempt to control Connecticut, but was
humbled and prevented and, in fact, driven away
by Captain Wadsworth.</p>

<p>In 1689, the charter was brought out from the
long place of concealment, a popular assembly was
convened, Robert Treat was chosen governor, and
Connecticut again assumed the position of an independent
colony.</p>

<p>The name of Captain Wadsworth will ever be
dear to the people of Connecticut, and so will the
venerable oak which concealed their charter.</p>

</div></div>


<p>Mr. George Waters, the escaped slave from
Virginia, lived very quietly at the home of Mrs.
Stevens. His daughter was constantly with him,
save when he made strange and unknown pilgrimages.
During these mysterious visits, she stayed
at the house of Mrs. Stevens.</p>

<p>Cora was a quiet little maid, whose hopes seemed
crushed by some calamity. She never forgot that
her father, the once proud man, had been arrested
and sold as a slave. That long period of servitude,
the flight and the fight were things which never
faded from her mind. In the eyes of Charles
Stevens, there was something singularly attractive
about this child. She was so strange, so silent and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
melancholy, that he felt for her the keenest sympathy.
She lived in the shadow of some dark mystery,
which he could not fathom. Her strange
father was non-communicative and silent as the
grave.</p>

<p>Charles felt an interest in these people. It was
a strange interest, one he could not understand
himself, and like all good boys, when he wanted
wisdom and information, he went to his mother.</p>

<p>"Mother, do you ever talk with Cora?" he asked
one day.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you ever talk with her about England?"</p>

<p>"I have; but it seems her father was a roving
player, without any fixed abode."</p>

<p>"And her mother?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Stevens, who was busy sewing, answered:</p>

<p>"I know nothing of her mother."</p>

<p>"Have you never asked about her?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Has she never mentioned her mother's name?"</p>

<p>"She has not."</p>

<p>The girl was nearly always at the home of Mrs.
Stevens, though she sometimes took strolls alone
through the town.</p>

<p>The melancholy child attracted the attention of
Good-wife Nurse, who asked her to her house and
brought her a mug of fresh milk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you belong here?" asked Goody Nurse.</p>

<p>"I suppose we do," was the answer. "Father
is here part of the time."</p>

<p>"And your mother?"</p>

<p>"I have none."</p>

<p>"Did she die in England?"</p>

<p>"Alas, I know not."</p>

<p>"Do you remember seeing her?"</p>

<p>Cora shook her head, and a shadow passed over
her face.</p>

<p>"Has your father ever told you about her?"
asked Goody Nurse.</p>

<p>"No, madame; I have not heard him speak her
name."</p>

<p>Then Goody Nurse, with a curiosity that was
natural, sought to question the child about her
former life; but all she could gain was that her
father had been a strolling player.</p>

<p>Players were not in good repute in New England
at this time. The prejudice against the theatre,
growing out of the rupture between the actors
and the Roman Catholic Church, was inherited by
the Protestants, who, to some extent, still continue
their war against the stage. The fact that George
Waters had been an actor was sufficient to condemn
him in the eyes of the Puritans.</p>

<p>When Mr. Parris learned that a player was in
their midst, he elevated his ecclesiastical nose, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
seemed to sniff the brimstone of Satan. When he
learned that some of the dissenting members of his
congregation had been guilty of the heinous sin of
speaking kind words to the motherless child of a
player, he shook his wise head knowingly and declared,
"Truly Satan is kind to his own." He
made the player a subject for his next Lord's day
sermon, in which he sought to pervert the scriptures
to suit his prejudices. The subject of witchcraft
was beginning to excite some attention, and he
managed in almost every sermon to ring in enough
of it to keep up the agitation. In the course of
his discourse, he declared:</p>

<p>"The New Englanders are a people of God settled
in those, which were the devil's territories, and
it may easily be supposed that the devil is exceedingly
disturbed, when he perceives such people
here, accomplishing the promises of old, made unto
our blessed Jesus, that he should have the uttermost
parts of the earth for his possessions. There was
not a greater uproar among the Ephesians, when
the gospel was first brought among them, than there
is now among the powers of the air after whom
those Ephesians walked, when first the silver trumpets
of the gospel made the joyful sound in their
dark domain. The devil, thus irritated, hath tried
all sorts of methods to overturn this poor plantation."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>With this preface he assailed the unfortunate
actor and his innocent child as being tools of his
Satanic majesty, and denounced those who would
lift the wounded, bleeding and beaten wayfarer
from the road-side, carry him home, or offer his
unfortunate child a cup of cold water as agents of
darkness. Mr. Parris had forgotten some of the
commands of the divine Master, whom he professed
to follow. He assailed "the little maid furiously."
That child of sorrow and of tears, whom he had
never seen before, and whose young heart ached
from the wrongs heaped on her innocent young
head, was to him an object of demoniac fury.</p>

<p>She sat in the rear of the church, and, covering
her face with her hands as Mr. Parris assailed her
father and herself, the tears silently trickled through
her small fingers. Goody Nurse, who sat near the
child, bent over and whispered some encouraging
words in her ear.</p>

<p>"Verily, the Devil's own will be the Devil's
own!" declared the pastor, his eyes flashing with
fury. "When one of Satan's imps hath been
wounded by a shaft of truth, shot from the bow of
God, the angels of darkness, verily, will hover over
the suffering devil, and seek to undo what God
hath done." He called on those suffering from
the familiar spirits to behold one even now willing
to soothe the offspring of a wicked player.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>When Cora left the church that day, she asked
Mrs. Stevens why Mr. Parris hated her and said
such hard things about her. "Surely I never
did him harm, and why doth he assail me so
cruelly?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Stevens strove to comfort the wounded
feelings of the child, by assuring Cora that it was
the mistaken zeal of the minister, who, but for the
scales of prejudice covering his eyes, would by no
means be so cruel with her.</p>

<p>"Oh, would that father would return and take
me from this place!" sobbed Cora.</p>

<p>"Cora, are you tired of me? Have I not been
kind to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you have, and I thank you for all your
goodness."</p>

<p>"Are you not happy with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I could be very happy, did not Mr. Parris
say such vile things of my father and myself. Do
you think me one of Satan's imps?"</p>

<p>"No, no, sweet child; you are one of God's
angels."</p>

<p>"But I am the child of a player, and he said
none such could enter into the kingdom of the
Lord."</p>

<p>"That is but a display of his prejudice and ignorance,
Cora. I have read the good book from beginning
to end, and nowhere do I see anything in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
God's Holy Bible that excludes even the player
from entering into eternal rest."</p>

<p>"But he, the interpreter of God's word, says we
are doomed."</p>

<p>"He says more than is narrated in the Book of
Life. If the ministers would only keep constantly
in their minds these words: 'For I testify unto
every man that heareth the words of the prophecy
of this book. If any man shall add unto these
things, God shall add unto him the plagues that
are written in this book,' then there would be less
misconstructions put upon the Bible. Men would
be more careful not to accuse their brother, while
the beam was in their own eye. Why, Cora, you
are but a child, and Christ said: 'Suffer little
children to come unto me and forbid them not, for
of such is the kingdom of Heaven.' Now, instead
of following the holy precept of the Master, whom
he feigns to serve, he declares you an imp of darkness.
His zeal hath made him mad. Where is
your father?"</p>

<p>"Alas, I know not."</p>

<p>"When will he return?"</p>

<p>"I know not."</p>

<p>"What are his plans?"</p>

<p>"I am wholly ignorant of them."</p>

<p>Next day Charles Stevens was wandering through
the forest near the spring where he rescued the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
wounded stranger some years before. Often had
he thought of that melancholy man and the strange
resemblance he bore to Cora's father.</p>

<p>"Where is he now, and what has been his fate?"
he thought, as he strolled toward the spring. Suddenly
he paused and looked toward the brooklet.
Well might he be startled. The negro servants,
John and Tituba, were engaged in some of their
diabolical incantations in the stream. Kneeling
by the water's side, each bent until their foreheads
touched the water, then, starting up, they murmured
strange fetich words in their diabolical African
tongue. John had a whip in his hand, with
which he lashed the water furiously, and uttered
his eldritch shrieks. Charles paused, spell-bound,
hardly knowing what to make of the strange conduct
of the negroes, and wishing he could lay the
whip about their own bare shoulders.</p>

<p>During a lull in their performance, he heard a
rapid tread of feet coming toward the spring,
and beheld his mother, followed by Cora. No
sooner did the negroes see them, than they left off
lashing the water with their whips and, with the
most wild, unearthly screams, bounded from the
spot and ran off into the woods.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stevens and Cora both screamed, and were
about to fly, when Charles emerged from his place
of concealment, saying:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't run away, I am here."</p>

<p>"Charles! Charles! what were they doing?"
Mrs. Stevens asked.</p>

<p>"It was some of their wild incantations," he
answered. "The knaves deserve to have a good
whip laid about their bare backs."</p>

<p>"Truly, they do. Why did they fly at our
approach?" asked Mrs. Stevens.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the foolish creatures thought their
spell was broken," Charles answered.</p>

<p>"I am so affrighted," said Cora, shuddering.
She was growing dizzy, and Mrs. Stevens said:</p>

<p>"Catch her, or she will fall."</p>

<p>He bore her to the spring and, kneeling by the
brook, bathed the fair white brow, until she opened
her eyes and murmured:</p>

<p>"Mother!"</p>

<p>Many times afterward, both mother and son,
recalling the incident, wondered why she, for the
first time, had called for her mother. At all other
times and on all other occasions, the maid persistently
denied that she knew aught of her mother.</p>

<p>A few days later, her father, who had mysteriously
and unceremoniously disappeared, returned.
No one asked any questions as to where he had
been, or what business had engaged his attention.
He gave the widow some golden guineas for her
care of his child. That night Charles came accidentally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
upon the father and daughter in the garden.
They were sitting in a green bower, partially
screened from view, so he approached to within a
few paces without being seen.</p>

<p>"Father, have you heard anything more?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nor have you seen any one from there?"</p>

<p>"I have not."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose danger is over?"</p>

<p>"Danger never will be over, until there has been
a revolution in the government."</p>

<p>Long did Charles ponder over those mysterious
words, and ask himself what they meant. He
again conferred with his mother, and when she had
heard all he had to tell, she was constrained to ask:</p>

<p>"Who are they?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Stevens, like her son, was too well bred to
pry into the secrets of her guests. A few days
later Mr. Waters again disappeared and was not
seen for two months.</p>

<p>It was at the close of a sultry day in July that
Mr. John Louder and his neighbor Bly were returning
from Boston in a cart. As usual, their conversation
was of the solemn kind, characteristic of the
Puritan. The many mysteries in nature and out
of nature formed their principal topic. Each had
had his long, ardent conflict with sin and Satan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Each was a firm believer in personal devils and
legions of devils. The spirits of the air were
thought to be all about them, even at that very
moment.</p>

<p>"Neighbor Bly, I believe that she is a witch,"
said Louder.</p>

<p>"Verily, even so do I."</p>

<p>"If the magistrates would so adjudge her, she
would, according to the laws, be hung."</p>

<p>"Truly she would. I saw her shape again last
night."</p>

<p>"Did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she came to my bed and did grievously
torment me, by sitting for fully two hours upon
my chest."</p>

<p>"Why did you not call upon the name of God,
and she would have gone?"</p>

<p>"Fain would I have done so, had it been possible;
but her appearance took from me the power
of speech, and I was dumb. She sat upon me,
grinning at me, and she said:</p>

<p>"'Would ye speak if ye could?'</p>

<p>"Then at last a yellow bird came in at the window
and whispered some words in her ear, and the
shape flew away with a black man."</p>

<p>"Verily, neighbor Bly, you have been grievously
tormented; yet little worse is your case than my
own. My cattle are bewitched and die. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
witches hurl balls at them from any distance, which
strike them, and they shrink and die at once. The
other morn I had salted my cows, when one suddenly
showed strange signs of illness and soon fell
on her side and did die. Neighbor Towne, who
witnessed it, said the poor beast was struck with
a witch ball. He says they gather the hair from
the back of the afflicted beasts and, making a ball
of it from the spittle of their mouths, blow their
breath upon it and hurl it any distance to an object.
The object so struck will at once wither and die.
He said that, should I strip the hair from the spine
of the dead brute, a ball made of it would strike
down any other beast of the herd, even if thrown
by my own hand."</p>

<p>With a sigh, Bly said:</p>

<p>"Truly, we live in the age when the devil is to
be loosed for a little season. Would to Heaven,
St. John would again chain the dragon."</p>

<p>The sun had almost dipped behind the long line
of blue hills. A listless repose, peculiar to New
England autumns, seemed to have settled over the
hills and valleys about the neighborhood of Salem.
A drowsy, dreamy influence overhung land and
sea and pervaded the very atmosphere. No wonder
that the superstitious Puritans of that day and
age believed the place bewitched. Certain it is, that
it seemed under the same power, that held strange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
spells over the minds of the good people, causing
them to walk in a continual revery. These early
Puritans were given to all kinds of marvellous beliefs,
as we have seen, subjected to trances and
visions, and frequently saw strange sights, and
heard wonderful noises in the air. All Salem
abounded with local tales, haunted spots and twilight
superstitions. Shooting stars and flaming
meteors were more often seen about that enchanted
spot, than in any other part of the country.</p>

<p>The two travellers silently jogged along in the
cart, casting occasional glances down the road.
Just before reaching Salem, the road dipped below
the trees, which concealed some glens and breaks,
above which only the church, standing in the suburb
of the village, could be seen. The sequestered
situation of the meeting-house seemed to have
always made it a favorite resort for troubled spirits.
It stood on a knoll, surrounded by beech trees and
lofty elms, from among which its decent whitewashed
walls shone modestly forth, as the only
bright object among so much sombre gloom and
shade. A broad path wound its way down a gentle
slope to the creek, which emptied into the bay,
bordered by tall trees, through which glimpses of
the sea and blue hills might be caught. Between
the travellers and the church extended a wide,
woody dell, along which the brook roved among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
broken rocks and trunks of fallen trees. Over a
deep, black part of the stream was thrown a bridge.
The road which led up to it was thickly shaded,
and in places indistinguishable at any great distance
by overhanging trees, which cast a gloom
about it, even in daytime, but occasioned a fearful
darkness at night. This place was reputed to be a
favorite resort for the witches of Salem, for they
had frequently been seen dancing upon the bridge.</p>

<p>It was with some degree of nervousness that the
travellers drew near to the bridge. The sun had
dipped behind the blue hills of the west, and the
pale, lambent glow of the evening star shot athwart
the sky, ere the bridge was reached. While it was
yet twilight in the uplands, it was night here.
The hollow sounds of the horse's feet on the bridge
chilled the hearts of the occupants of the cart, and
when the outline of a horse and rider appeared on
the other side, Louder seized Bly by the arm and
gasped:</p>

<p>"God save us! Where did they come from?
They were not there a moment before."</p>

<p>"They rose up out of the ground."</p>

<p>Their horse, which was very much frightened,
would have dashed down the road had not the horseman
brought his steed directly across their path.</p>

<p>"Your beast seems affrighted," coolly remarked
the horseman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>At sound of his voice, Louder gave utterance to
a wild yell of dismay. The horse stood trembling
and refused to move the cart an inch. Louder
rose from the seat and glared through the deepening
gloom at the stranger. That white face, those
great, sad eyes once seen could never be forgotten.
He uttered a yell of horror, crying:</p>

<p>"Begone, wizard! The armor of God be between
me and thee! Fiend of the regions of darkness,
it was thou who offered me the book to sign.
Away! begone! tempt me no more, for, by the
grace of Heaven, I defy you! I will not sign!"</p>

<p>At this moment, the horse at the cart, seeing an
opening in the road, dashed on to the village, leaving
the horseman gazing in mute wonder after
them. His white face wore a puzzled and pained
look. He turned his horse's head into another
path, saying:</p>

<p>"It has been some years since I was here, and
yet, if I mistake not, this is surely the path that
leads to her house."</p>

<p>Thirty minutes later, the same horseman drew
rein in front of the widow Stevens' cottage and,
dismounting, tied his horse to a small tree and approached
the house. A light was shining through
the window, and the whirr of the wheel told that
the industrious widow was at her evening work.
He rapped at the door and was bidden enter. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
entering, he discovered that three persons occupied
the cottage&mdash;the widow, her son and a beautiful,
sunny-haired maiden. The latter started up at his
appearance, crying:</p>

<p>"Father! father!" and, leaping forward, threw
her arms about his neck. The new-comer looked
in amazement upon the girl, but made no answer.</p>

<p>"Father, father, why don't you speak?"</p>

<p>"There is some mistake!" he began.</p>

<p>"Are you not my father?"</p>

<p>"I never saw you before, little maid."</p>

<p>Then Cora started back and gave the stranger a
curious glance. He looked exactly like her father,
save that he was dressed almost wholly in buckskin,
and had a wild, forest-like appearance.
Then, as she scrutinized him more closely, she perceived
a slight scar on his left cheek. This was
not on her father's face.</p>

<p>"You are not my father; but you are very like
him," she said.</p>

<p>"I am not your father, little maid. I came to
thank these people for their kindness to me a few
years ago."</p>

<p>"Are you he whom I found by the brook,
wounded and dying?" asked Charles.</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Your mysterious disappearance occasioned
much comment."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the stranger could frame an answer, the
door was again thrown open, and this time it was
Cora's father, in reality, who entered the house.
She sprang to him, saying:</p>

<p>"Father, I see now there is a difference between
you and him!"</p>

<p>For the first time, George Waters saw the
stranger. As their eyes met, each started, gazed
at the other a moment, as if to be assured he was
right, and then George Waters cried:</p>

<p>"Harry!"</p>

<p>"George!"</p>

<p>A dramatic episode, such as is so often acted
upon the stage, or described in novels, followed,
and, by degrees, the small audience caught from
words dropped by the men, that they were brothers,
who had long been separated, and had been searching
for each other.</p>

<p>When the excitement attending the discovery
had in a measure subsided, the brothers walked
down toward the spring, where, seating themselves
on a moss-grown stone, George Waters told his
brother of joining Monmouth's army, of being arrested
and sold as a slave in Virginia, and of his
escape and long perilous flight to New England.</p>

<p>"Where have you been since you were here,
Harry?"</p>

<p>"I was a captive among the Indians for a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
months, was liberated by some French Jesuits and
went to France and thence to England, hoping to
see you. I was several weeks at our old home near
Stockton. Then I came back to America and have
been in New York trading in furs."</p>

<p>A silence of several moments followed. George,
whose soul seemed stirred with some deep emotions,
asked:</p>

<p>"Harry, while in England, in Stockton, did you
see her?"</p>

<p>Harry knew to whom he referred, and he answered:</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"I know not."</p>

<p>"Do you know whether she be living or dead?"</p>

<p>"I do not."</p>

<p>"God grant that she be dead!"</p>

<p>At this moment, Cora, who had followed behind
them and overheard their strange words, came forward
and asked:</p>

<p>"Father, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, child. There, let us return to the
house, for it is growing late."</p>

<p>Then, as they walked up the gentle slope to the
cabin of the widow, the maiden repeated to herself:</p>

<p>"But he does mean something!"</p>

<p>The Stevens family were so intimately related
to their country, that the history of one is the history
of the other. Philip Stevens, or Estevan, had
located in the south and left behind a numerous
progeny, while his brother Mathew, who came over
in the <i>Mayflower</i>, had left an equally large family
in New England. Their descendants began to
push out into the frontier colonies, those in the
south going as far north as Pennsylvania, and those
in the east pushing out westward to New York and
New Jersey.</p>

<p>The family were lovers of freedom, and, wherever
a struggle has been made on American soil for
liberty, one of these descendants of the youth who
landed on American soil with Columbus, in 1492,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
has been found. They disliked Andros, and the
members of this now extensive and widely scattered
family were in sackcloth and ashes, so to speak,
when King James, in 1688, gave Andros a vice-regal
commission to rule New York and all New
England.</p>

<p>When the viceroy journeyed from Boston to
New York City, early in August the same year,
George Stevens, a cousin of Charles, accompanied
him, and saw Andros received by Colonel Bayard's
regiment of foot and horse, who was entertained
by the loyal aristocrat. In the midst of the rejoicings,
the news came that the queen, the second
wife of James, had been blessed with a son, who
became heir to the throne. The event was celebrated
the same evening by bonfires in the streets
and a feast at the city hall. At the latter, Major
Van Cortlandt became so hilarious, that he made
a burnt sacrifice to his loyalty of his hat and periwig,
waving the burning victims over the banquet
table on the point of his straight sword.</p>

<p>Princess Mary, the eldest daughter of King
James, had married the Prince of Orange, and this
new birth in the royal family was a disappointment
to the Dutch inhabitants of New York, as
well as the Protestant republicans, who had begun
to hope that William and Mary would succeed
James to the throne of England. This event intensified<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
the general discontent, because of the consolidation
of New York with New England and the
abridgment of their rights, and the people were
ready to rebel at almost any moment, especially
as Andros had rendered himself particularly obnoxious.</p>

<p>Like the other colonies, Maryland was shaken
by the revolution in England, in 1688, and, for
a while, experienced deep sorrows. The democratic
ideas, which, for several years, had been spreading
over the provinces, could not reconcile the rule of
a lord proprietor with the true principles of republicanism.
Even when Charles Calvert went to
England after the death of his father, signs of
political discontent were conspicuous in Maryland.
In 1678, the general assembly, influenced by the
popular feeling, established the right of suffrage&mdash;"casting
of a vote for rulers"&mdash;on a broad basis.
On the return of Charles, in 1681, he annulled this
act and, by an arbitrary ordinance, resisted the
right of freemen owning fifty acres of land, or personal
property of the value of forty pounds sterling.
This produced great disquietude, and Ex-Governor
Fendall planned an insurrection for the purpose of
abolishing the proprietorship and establishing an
independent republican government. The king
was induced to issue orders that all the offices of
the government in Maryland should be filled by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Protestants alone; and so, again, the Roman Catholics
were deprived of their political rights.</p>

<p>Lord Baltimore went to England again, in 1684,
leaving the government of his province in charge of
several deputies under the nominal governorship
of his infant son. There he found his rights in
great peril; but before the matter could be brought
to a direct issue by the operation of a writ of <i>quo
warranto</i>, King James was driven from the throne,
and Protestant William and Mary ascended it.
Lord Baltimore immediately acquiesced in the
political change. On account of his instructions
to his deputies to proclaim the new monarchs being
delayed in their transmission, he was charged with
hesitancy; and a restless spirit named Coode, an
associate of Fendall in his insurrectionary movements&mdash;"a
man of loose morals and blasphemous
speech"&mdash;excited the people by the cry of "a popish
plot!" He was the author of a false story put
in circulation, that the local magistrates in Maryland
and the Roman Catholics there had engaged
with the Indians in a plot for the destruction of the
Protestants in the province. An actual league at
that time between the French and the Jesuit missionaries
with the savages on the New England
frontiers for the destruction of the English colonies
in the east seemed to give color to the story, which
created great excitement. The old feud burned intensely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
The Protestants formed an armed association
led by Coode. They marched to the Maryland
capital, took possession of the records and assumed
the functions of a provisional government, in May,
1689. In the following August they met in convention,
when they prepared and sent to the new
sovereigns a report of their proceedings, and a
series of absurd and false accusations against Lord
Baltimore. In conclusion, they requested the
monarchs to depose Lord Baltimore by making
Maryland a royal province and taking it under the
protection of the crown.</p>

<p>William and Mary listened favorably to the request
and, moved by the false representations, complied
with it. Coode was ordered to administer
the government in the name of the king. He
ruled with the spirit of a petty tyrant, until the
people of every religious and political creed were
heartily disgusted with him, and, in 1692, he was
supplanted by Sir Lionel Copley, whom the king
sent to be governor of Maryland. On the arrival
of the new governor, in the spring of 1692, he
summoned a general assembly, to meet at St.
Mary's in May. New laws abolishing religious
toleration were instituted. The church of England
was made the state church for Maryland, to be supported
by a tax on the whole people.</p>

<p>"Thus," says McMahan, "was introduced, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the first time in Maryland, a church establishment,
sustained by law and fed by general taxation."
Other laws oppressive in their bearings upon those
opposed in religious views to the dominant party
were enacted, some of which remained in force until
the glorious emancipation day, in the summer
of 1776, gave freedom to our nation.</p>

<p>Partly in order to better accommodate the people
of Maryland, but more for the purpose of punishing
the adherents of Lord Baltimore, who constituted
a greater proportion of the population of St.
Mary's, the seat of government was moved from
there to Anne Arundel, a town on the shore of the
Chesapeake, early in 1694, and there a general assembly
was convened in February. The following
year, the name of the place was changed by
authority to Annapolis, and the naval station of
the province was established there. Annapolis
has, ever since, continued to be the capital of Maryland,
while St. Mary's, dependent for its existence
upon its being the capital of the province, speedily
sunk into ruins.</p>

<p>Lord Baltimore never recovered his proprietary
rights. Neither did he return to America, but died
in England in the year 1714, at the age of eighty-five
years. He was succeeded by his son Benedict
Leonard Calvert. That son had abandoned the
faith of his father and, in the spring of 1715, died,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
when his title to the province devolved upon his
infant son Charles, who, with his brothers and
sisters, had been educated as Protestants. Charles
Calvert, Lord Baltimore and William Penn were
contemporaries, and were equally conspicuous for
their beneficent disposition. They are regarded as
the best of all the proprietors, who owned charted
domains in America.</p>

<p>Rufus Stevens, an uncle of Charles Stevens, the
youth of Salem, was living in New Jersey, when
Lord Berkeley, disgusted by the losses and annoyances
which the ownership of the colony brought
upon him, sold his interests in the province to John
Fenwick and Edward Byllinge, English Friends,
or Quakers, for the sum of five thousand dollars.
The tract thus disposed of was in the western part
of the province. With some emigrants, mostly of
the society of Friends, Fenwick sailed for his new
possessions. They entered at a spot not far from
the Delaware River, which they named Salem, on
account of the peaceful aspect of the country and
the surrounding Indians. There, with the peculiar
gravity of the sect, Fenwick and his two daughters,
thirteen men (most of them heads of families) and
one woman, the wife of one of the emigrants, sat
in silent worship, according to their custom, under
the shadow of a great tree, with covered heads
and quiet bodies, on the ensuing "First Day" after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
their arrival. Then they built log cabins for shelter,
and so began a new life in the wilds of New Jersey.</p>

<p>The principal proprietor was Byllinge; but soon
after the departure of Fenwick, heavy losses in
trade made him a bankrupt, and his interest in
New Jersey was first assigned to William Penn and
others for the benefit of his creditors, and was afterward
sold to them. These purchasers and others
who became associated with them, unwilling to
maintain a political union with other parties, bargained
with Carteret for a division of the province.
This was done in July, 1676, Carteret retaining
the eastern part of the province, and the new purchasers
holding the western part. From that time,
until they were united and became a royal province
in 1702, these divisions were known as East and
West Jersey. Even to this day, we frequently
hear the expression, "The Jerseys," used.</p>

<p>Most of the settlers of West Jersey were Friends,
and the proprietors gave them a remarkably liberal
constitution of government, entitled: "The concessions
and agreements of the proprietors, freeholders
and inhabitants of the province of West
Jersey in America." The following year (1677),
more than four hundred Friends came from England
and settled below the Raritan. Andros required
them to acknowledge his authority as the representative
of the Duke of York. This they refused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
to do, and the matter was referred to the eminent
crown-lawyer and oriental scholar, Sir William
Jones, for adjudication. Sir William decided
against the claims of the duke, who submitted to
the decision, released both provinces from allegiance
to him, and the Jerseys became independent of
foreign control. The first popular assembly in
West Jersey met at Salem, in November, 1681,
and adopted a code of laws for the government of
the people. One of these laws provided that in all
criminal cases, excepting treason, murder and theft,
the aggrieved party should have power to pardon
the offender.</p>

<p>In the year 1679, Carteret died, and the trustees
of his American estates offered East Jersey for sale.
It was bought, in 1682, by William Penn and
others, among them the earl of Perth, the friend
of Robert Barclay, whom the proprietors appointed
governor for life. Barclay was an eminent young
Friend, whose writings were held in high estimation
by his own sect, especially his "Apology for
the true Christian Divinity, as the same is held
forth and practised by the people called in scorn
Quakers," and his "Treatise on Christian Discipline."
The purchase of these lands was not made
in the interest of either religion or liberty, but as a
speculation. Barclay governed the province by
deputies until 1690.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>England and Scotland contributed a large number
of Friends to East Jersey, and other immigrants
flocked from Long Island, to find repose and peace;
but repose is not to be found by lovers of freedom,
under royal rule, and they were forcibly impressed
with the significance of the injunction, "Put not
your trust in princes," for James the king failed to
keep the rosy promises of James the duke, and
they were forced to submit to the tyranny of Andros.
When that detested viceroy was expelled
from the country, in 1689, the Jerseys were left
without a regular civil government, and so they
remained for several years. Wearied with contentions,
with the people of the provinces and with
the government at home, and annoyed by losses in
unprofitable speculations, the proprietors of the
Jerseys surrendered them to the crown, in 1702,
when Queen Anne was the reigning British monarch.
The government of that domain was then
confided to Sir Edward Hyde (Lord Cornbury),
whose instructions constituted the supreme law of
the land. He was then governor of New York and
possessed almost absolute legislative and executive
control within the jurisdiction of his authority.
In New Jersey the people had no voice in the
judiciary or the making and executing of laws other
than recommendatory. All but Roman Catholics
were granted liberty of conscience; but the bigoted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
governor always showed conspicuous favors to the
members of the Church of England. The governor
was dishonest and a libertine, and under his rule
the people of New Jersey were little better than
slaves. Printing, except by royal permission, was
prohibited in the province, and the traffic in negro
slaves was especially encouraged.</p>

<p>New Jersey remained a dependency of New
York, yet with a distinct legislative assembly of
its own, until the year 1738, when it was made an
independent colony, and it so remained until the
Revolutionary War, when it became a separate
State. After the province gained its freedom from
New York, Mr. Morris was commissioned its governor.
He was the son of an officer in Cromwell's
army, who, about the year 1672, settled on a farm
of three thousand acres on the Harlem River, New
York, which was named Morrisania.</p>

<p>Last of the royal governors of New Jersey was
William Franklin, son of Dr. Benjamin Franklin,
who was appointed in 1763, and closed his official
career in the summer of 1776, when he was deposed
by the continental congress and sent under
guard to Connecticut. There he was released on
parole and went to England, where he died in
1813.</p>

<p>One of the Stevens family having served as governor
of North Carolinia, it was only natural that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
other members of the southern branch of that rapidly
increasing family in the south should push out into
the Carolinias and take part in the early settlement
of these colonies.</p>

<p>After the failure of the schemes of Loche and
Cooper to form "Fundamental Constitutions,"
a splendid government, in 1669, was completed.
The "constitutions" were signed in March, 1670,
and were highly lauded in England, as forming
the wisest scheme for human government ever
devised. Monk, Duke of Albemarle, was created
palatine or viceroy for the new empire, who was to
display the state parade of his office, with landgraves,
barons, lords of manor and heraldry, among
the scattered settlers in pine forests, living in log
cabins with the Indians. Never was a more ludicrous
idea entertained with any degree of seriousness;
yet, so far as the proprietors were concerned,
this splendid government was established; but the
simple settlers had something to say; and when
the governor of the Albemarle county colony attempted
to introduce the new government, they
said, "No." They had a form of government of
their own, far better adapted to their social circumstances
than the one sent from England, and they
resolved to adhere to it.</p>

<p>All attempts to enforce obedience to the new
form of government, all oppressive taxation imposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
upon the people, and especially the commercial
restrictions authorized by the English navigation
laws, produced wide-spread discontent.
Most particularly was this fostered by refugees
from Virginia, who had been engaged in Bacon's
rebellion, and who sought personal safety among
the people below the Roanoke. These refugees,
smarting under the lash of tyranny, scattered
broadcast over the generous soil the germinal ideas
of popular freedom, and successful oppression was
made difficult, if not impossible.</p>

<p>At this period, North Carolinia did not contain
four thousand inhabitants. They carried on a
small trade in tobacco, maize and fat cattle with
the merchants of New England. This sort of
smuggling was perhaps excusable, when we consider
the grinding navigation laws of the monopolists.
The little vessels, trading between North
Carolinia and New England, brought many articles
to the southern colonies, which they were incapable
of producing. English cupidity envied them their
small prosperity, and the navigation laws of 1672
were put in force. An agent of the government
appeared, who demanded a penny for every pound
of tobacco sent to New England. The colonists resisted
the levy and the tax-gatherer became rude
and had frequent collisions with the people. On
one occasion, he went to the home of Francisco<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
to a relative in Boston, and demanded a steer in
payment for the shipment. The tax-gatherer attempted
to drive away the ox, when the sturdy
wife assailed him with her mop-stick and drove
him from the premises.</p>

</div>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">The sturdy wife assailed him with her mop-stick and drove him away.</span></p>

<p>The exasperated people finally, in December,
1677, seized the public funds and imprisoned the
governor and six of his councillors, called a new
representative assembly and appointed a chief magistrate
and judge. Then, for two years, the colonists
were permitted to conduct the affairs of their
government without any foreign control. Meanwhile,
John Culpepper, their leader, whom the
royalists denounced as an "ill man, who merited
hanging for endeavoring to set the people to plunder
the rich," conscious of his integrity, went boldly
to England to plead the cause of the colony.
While in the act of re-embarking for America, he
was arrested, tried for treason and honorably acquitted.
Returning to North Carolinia, he was
appointed surveyor-general of the province, and,
in 1680, laid out the city of Charleston in South
Carolinia.</p>

<p>Until the arrival of Seth Sothel as governor,
North Carolinia enjoyed a period of repose. He
had purchased a share in the provinces of Clarendon,
and was sent to administer the government.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
On his voyage, he was captured by Algerine
pirates, but, escaping them, reached North Carolinia,
in 1683.</p>

<p>It has been said of this avaricious, extortionate
and cruel statesman, that "the dark shades of his
character were not relieved by a single virtue."
His advent disturbed the public tranquillity. He
plundered the people, cheated the proprietors, and
on all occasions seems to have prostituted his delegated
power to purposes of private gain. About
six weeks of his misrule were all the independent
colonists could stand. Then the people rose in rebellion,
seized the governor, and were about to
send him to England to answer their accusations
before the proprietors, when he asked to be tried
by the colonial assembly. It is asserted by historians
of note, that that body was more merciful
than his associates in England would have been,
for they found him guilty and sentenced him to
only one year's punishment and perpetual disqualification
for the office of governor.</p>

<p>Sothel withdrew to the southern colony, and was
succeeded by Philip Ludwell, an energetic, honest
man, whose wisdom and sense of justice soon restored
order and good feeling in the colony. He
was succeeded by John Archdale, a Quaker, who,
in 1695, came as governor of the two colonies. His
administration was a blessing. The people over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
whom he ruled were as free in their opinions and
actions as the air they breathed. Legal or moral
restraints were few; yet the gentle-minded people
were enemies to violence or crime. They were
widely scattered, with not a city or town and scarce
a hamlet within their sylvan domain. The only
roads were bridle paths from house to house, and
these were indicated by notches cut in trees&mdash;"blazed
roads." There was not a settled minister
in the colony until 1703.</p>

<p>The southern, or Carteret County Colony was,
meanwhile, steadily moving along in population
and wealth. The settlers, perceiving the fatal objections
to the "Fundamental Constitutions" as a
plan of government for their colony, did not attempt
conforming thereto, but established a more
simple government adapted to their conditions.
Under it, the first legislative assembly of South
Carolinia convened, in the spring of 1672, at the
place on the Ashley River where the colony was
first seated. In that body, jarring political, social
and theological interests and opinions produced
passionate debates and violent discord. South
Carolinia has ever been a seething political caldron,
and, even in that early date, there was a
proprietary party and a people's party, a high
church party and a dissenters' party, each bigoted
and resolute. At times, the debates were so heated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
and earnest, that they seemed on the eve of plunging
the colony into civil war.</p>

<p>The savages had commenced plundering the
frontier, and all factions of the whites were forced
to unite against this common enemy. The bold
frontiersman, with his trusty rifle, was often unable
to defend his home. His cattle were run
away or slaughtered before his very eyes. Old
Town was the first point selected for the capital;
but Charleston was finally laid out on Oyster Point,
and the seat of government was removed to this
city, where the second assembly met, in 1682.
Immigrants flowed in with a full and continuous
stream. Families came from Ireland, Scotland and
Holland, and when the edict at Nantes, which
secured toleration to Protestants in France, was
revoked, a large number of Huguenots fled from
their country, and many sought an asylum in the
Carolinias. The traditionary hatred of the English
for the French was shown at this time. For fully
ten years these French refugees were deprived the
privilege of citizenship in the land of their adoption.</p>

<p>A colony of Scotch Presbyterians, numbering
ten families, was located at Port Royal, South
Carolinia, in 1682, and four years later was attacked
and dispersed by the Spaniards, who claimed
Port Royal as a dependency of St. Augustine.</p>

<p>The persecution of the Huguenots in France<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
drove many to seek homes in the colonies, despite
English hatred to them.</p>

<p>The struggles of South Carolinia with the Indians,
and the attempted oppression of the home
government is but a repetition of the experience of
the other colonies, until the good John Archdale
came as governor of the Carolinias. His administration
was short, but highly beneficial. He healed
dissensions, established equitable laws, in the spirit
of a true Christian example of toleration and humanity.
He cultivated friendly intercourse with
the Indians and the Spaniards at St. Augustine, so
that his administration was marked as a season of
peace, prosperity and happiness.</p>

</div></div>


<p>In a thousand artless ways, Cora, despite the
strange mystery which seemed to envelop her, won
her way to the hearts of all who knew her. Goody
Nurse, who was a frequent caller at the home of
the widow Stevens, was loud in her praises of the
maiden, who had budded into womanhood. Charles
found her growing more shy, as she became more
mature and more beautiful; but as she grew more
reserved, her power over him became greater, until,
though unconscious of it, she had made him her
slave.</p>

<p>One day he met her in one of her short rambles
about the wood near the house. Her eyes were on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the ground, and her face was so sad that it seemed
to touch his heart. He went toward her, and she
started from her painful reverie and looked as if
she would fly.</p>

<p>"Cora, it is I, are you afraid of me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Then he went to her side and asked:</p>

<p>"Why are you so sad to-day?"</p>

<p>"Do I seem sad?"</p>

<p>"You look it."</p>

<p>"It is because of the good pastor's hatred of me.
You were not at Church last Lord's day?"</p>

<p>"No; I was in Boston."</p>

<p>"Hath not your mother told you of it?"</p>

<p>"She told me nothing."</p>

<p>Her sad eyes seemed to swim in tears, and
Charles entreated her to tell him what Mr. Parris
had said of her. Without answering his question,
she asked:</p>

<p>"What do you think of Goody Nurse and her
sisters, Goody Cloyse and Goody Easty?"</p>

<p>"They are very excellent women," Charles answered,
"I would that we had more like them."</p>

<p>"Is it wrong for a young maid such as I to keep
their company?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly not."</p>

<p>Charles saw that Cora had something to tell,
and he begged her to come to a large moss-covered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
log, on which they seated themselves, and then he
asked:</p>

<p>"Cora, who said it was wrong?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Parris."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"On last Lord's day he did upbraid us as the
emissaries of the Devil, and Goody Nurse avowed
if the minister did not cease to upbraid her in
church, she would absent herself."</p>

<p>"That would be a violation of law. All are
compelled to attend worship on Lord's day."</p>

<p>She was silent for several moments and then remarked:</p>

<p>"Can a law compel one to go where she is
maligned and all the calumnies hate can invent
heaped upon her head?"</p>

<p>"By the laws of the colony, all must attend
church on Lord's day."</p>

<p>The laws of the Puritans were exacting, and
ministers of the character of Mr. Parris took advantage
of them.</p>

<p>"It is sad," sighed Cora.</p>

<p>"What did Mr. Parris say of you on last Lord's
day, Cora?"</p>

<p>"I cannot recall all that he said. Even his text
I have forgotten, for, as he was announcing it,
Abigail Williams was seized with a grievous fit,
and did cry out that Goody Nurse was pinching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
her. When she became quiet, and the pastor
again announced his text, Abigail interrupted him
with: 'It is not a doctrinal text, and it is too
long.' He said that when the children of God
went to worship, Satan came also. Then he declared
that the Devil was in the church at that moment,
and he looked at Goody Nurse and me, who
sat near each other in the church. 'Do any of
you doubt that the imps of darkness are in your
presence? Behold how they associate the one with
the other. Those who afflict and persecute the
children of the righteous, and the unholy offspring
of a player!' He grew in a towering passion and
cried out so against me, that all eyes were turned
upon me, and I bowed my head. No sooner had
I done so, than he called on all to witness how
Satan rebuked dared not show his face in the house
of God. If I but looked on him to deny his
charges he called it the brazen impudence of a
child of darkness. All through his sermon, I sat
listening to reproof for what I cannot help, or the
frequent allusions to the familiar spirits of Goody
Nurse."</p>

<p>Tears quietly stole from the sad eyes and trickled
down the cheeks of the maiden. He sought to
console her and, to change her mind to a more
cheerful subject, asked:</p>

<p>"Where is your father?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Alas, I know not, save that he has gone with
his brother Harry Waters to Canada to procure
furs."</p>

<p>"Cora, what strange mystery surrounds your
life?"</p>

<p>"I know not."</p>

<p>"Don't you remember aught of your mother?"</p>

<p>"No; I never saw her. My earliest recollections
are of the theatre, where a nurse cared for me in
the greenroom, while my father performed on the
stage."</p>

<p>"Does he never talk of her?"</p>

<p>"My mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He never mentions her name."</p>

<p>"Have you never asked him about her?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What answer does he make?"</p>

<p>"He says I may learn all in due time."</p>

<p>To Charles Stevens, it was quite evident that
Cora's father was purposely putting off some important
revelation. He gazed upon her fair young
face and in it could see little or no resemblance to
her father. Then a suspicion entered his mind,
that she might not after all be the child of George
Waters. Though mysterious, Cora tried to conceal
nothing; her manner and conversation were
frank and open.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your father was captured at the battle of Sedgemore,
was he not?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he was impressed into the army of Monmouth.
My father had no interest in either army.
What were their quarrels to him? Part of the
time he was in the Netherlands, and a part of the
time in France, Scotland or Wales. I don't think
at any time he knew much of England's trouble.
We were roving all the time and thought little of
political questions. When he was arrested and
forced into Monmouth's army, at Bridgewater, he
asked whose army it was."</p>

<p>"And you followed him?"</p>

<p>"I followed at a distance and from a lofty hill
watched the long, hard struggle. Oh, such a scene
as it was! Ranks of cavalry and ranks of infantry
dashing at each other. Through the great volumes
of smoke and dust, I watched the regiment to
which my father had been attached. I saw it in
the thickest of the fight and, kneeling by a stone
fence, prayed God to spare him. God answered
my prayer, for he was spared. When I saw Monmouth's
army retreating and the ruthless butchers
of the king in pursuit, I ran down the lane, weeping
and wringing my hands, expecting to find his
dead body. I was very young then; but the scene
has been indelibly stamped on my memory.</p>

<p>"As I was running down the hill, I met him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
so covered with dust and blackened with gunpowder,
that at first I knew him not. He knew me, and,
as I swooned at his feet, he carried me across a
field to a road-side inn, where I recovered, and we
were about to resume our flight, when the king's
soldiers surrounded the house. One of the officers
cocked his pistol to shoot my father and would have
done so, had I not clung to his neck and presented
my body as a shield between him and the trooper's
bullet.</p>

<p>"'Spare him for the hangman,' suggested another.</p>

<p>"He was spared, and at the trial it appeared that
he held no commission in the rebel's army, so he
was condemned to ten years' penal servitude in the
colonies, and was sent to Virginia, whither I went,
also. Of our escape, through the kindness and
courage of your relative in Virginia, you already
know."</p>

<p>"Is your father going to take you away?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he says that my persecution at Salem
will cease as soon as he can prepare a home for me."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In Maine."</p>

<p>"Do you want to go away, Cora?"</p>

<p>She was silent for a long while, in fact, so long
was she silent that he asked the question again before
she answered. Then, fixing her beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
eyes, with a startled expression, on him, she answered:</p>

<p>"No, no! I would not go away, if I could remain
in peace; but our persecutions seem endless. My
father is a good man. Although he was a player,
he was ever the kindest of fathers, and taught me
only the purest religious sentiments, yet Mr. Parris
calls him the agent of the devil."</p>

<p>Charles shudderingly responded:</p>

<p>"Cora, I fear we are on the verge of a fearful
upheaval of ignorance and superstition. Religion,
our greatest blessing, perverted, will become our
greatest curse. I cannot understand it, Cora; but
we are on the brink of some terrible volcano, which
will destroy many, I fear."</p>

<p>That Charles Stevens was no false prophet, subsequent
history has fully proven. Coming events
seemed to cast their dark shadows before. In New
England, there had been a preparation for this
stage in the temper with which the adventurers had
arrived in the country, and the influences which at
once operated upon them. Their politics and religion
were gloomy and severe. Those who were
not soured with the world were sad, and, it should
be remembered, they fully believed that Satan and
his powers were abroad and must be contended
with daily and hourly and in every transaction of
life. There was little in their new home to cheer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
them; for the gloomy and unexplored forests
shrouded the entire land beyond the barren seashore.
Their special enemy, the Indian, always
on the alert in some mysterious glade to take advantage
of them, was not, in their view, a simple
savage. Their clergy, ignorant and fanatic as they
were zealous, assured them that the Indians were
worshippers and agents of Satan; and it is difficult
to estimate the effect of this belief on the minds
and tempers of those who were thinking of the
Indians at every turn of daily life. Indian hatred
has ever been mingled with ferocity and fanaticism
quite inconsistent with mild precepts of Jesus
Christ. This passion, kindled by the first demonstration
of hostility on the part of the Massachusetts
red man, grew and spread incessantly under the
painful early experience of colonial life, and has
been only intensified by time. In turn, every
man had to be scout by day and night, in the swamp
and in the forest, and every woman had to be on
the watch in her husband's absence to save her
babes from murderers and kidnappers. Whatever
else their desires might be, even to supply their
commonest needs, the citizens had first to station
themselves within hail of each other all day, and
at night to drive in their cattle among the dwellings
and keep watch by turns. Even on Sundays,
patrols were appointed to look to the public safety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
while the citizens were at church. Mothers carried
their babes to the meeting-house in preference to
remaining at home in the absence of husbands and
neighbors. The Sabbath patrol was not only for
the purpose of looking for Indians, but to mark
the absentees from worship, note what they were
doing, and give information accordingly to the
authorities. These patrols were chosen from the
leading men of the community&mdash;the most active,
vigilant and sensible&mdash;and one can easily perceive
that much ill-will might have accumulated in the
hearts of those whom they saw fit to report. Such
ill-will had its day of triumph when the Salem
tragedy reached its climax.</p>

<p>Levity, mirth and joy were condemned by the
Puritans, and nearly all amusements were discarded.
The merry whistle of the lad was ungodly
in their eyes, and Charles Stevens had come in for
his share of the reproof because God had given
him a light heart. Life to them was sombre, and,
usually, sombre lives lead to bloodshed, crime and
fanaticism.</p>

<p>Charles sought to instil some of his joy into the
sad life of the unfortunate maid. To him the sun
shone brightly, the flowers bloomed radiantly, and
the birds sang sweetly for the pleasure of man.
Life was earnest, but not austere, and religion did
not demand gloom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have no care for what Mr. Parris may say,"
he said. "His congregation is divided against
him, and he cannot harm you."</p>

<p>"Only a little longer, just a little longer, and I
will be gone where they can torment me no more,"
answered Cora. "In the forests of Maine, I will
be hidden from the eyes of my enemies and be
alone with God."</p>

<p>They rose and wandered down the path on either
side of which the densest of thickets grew. Both
were lost in thought. A shadow had come over
the face of Charles Stevens the moment Cora spoke
of going away. He had never admitted even to
himself that he loved her; yet, ever since that
stormy night when he volunteered to brave the
tempest and conducted her home, he had been
strangely impressed with Cora.</p>

<p>The mystery of her early life was somewhat repugnant
to one of his plain, outspoken nature; yet,
with all that, he was forcibly impressed by her
sweet, pure and sad disposition.</p>

<p>They were wandering pensively hand in hand
toward his mother's home, when a voice called to
them from across the brook. The sound of the
voice broke the spell, and, looking up, he saw
Sarah Williams coming toward them.</p>

<p>"Hold, will you, Charles Stevens, until I speak
to the one who accompanies you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>The young widow was greatly excited, and her
voice trembled with emotion.</p>

<p>"Who is that woman?" asked Cora, trembling
with agitation.</p>

<p>"Sarah Williams."</p>

<p>"I have seen her."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At church. She was the one who upbraided
Goody Nurse for being a witch."</p>

<p>Cora was greatly agitated, as she saw Sarah
Williams, with demoniacal fury, hastening toward
her. Surely she would do her no injury, for
Cora was not conscious of ever having given her
offence.</p>

<p>"Have no fears, Cora, she will not harm you.
I trow it is some commonplace matter of which she
would speak."</p>

<p>Thus assured, she had almost ceased to dread
the approach of the woman, when Sarah Williams
suddenly cried, in a voice trembling with fury:</p>

<p>"Cora Waters, have you no sense of shame?
Are you wholly given up to the evil one?"</p>

<p>"What mean you?" Cora asked.</p>

<p>"Why do you torment me?"</p>

<p>"I do not, knowingly."</p>

<p>"False tool of Satan! Did not your shape come
at me last night?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly not."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh woman, woman! why will you speak so
falsely? I saw you."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Last night, as I lay in my bed, you came and
choked me, because I would not sign the little red
book which you carried in your hand."</p>

<p>Filled with wonder, Charles Stevens turned his
eyes upon Cora, whose face expressed blank amazement,
and asked:</p>

<p>"What does this mean?"</p>

<p>"I take God to be my witness, that I know nothing
of it, no more than the child unborn," she answered.</p>

<p>"Woe is the evil one, who speaks falsely when
accused!" cried the enraged Sarah Williams. Then
she closed her fist and made an effort to strike Cora,
who, with a scream, shrunk from her.</p>

<p>"Hold, Sarah Williams! Don't judge hastily,
or you may judge wrongly."</p>

<p>"Go to! hold your peace, Charles Stevens, for,
verily, I know whereof I speak, when I charge
that the shape of Cora Waters does grievously torment
me."</p>

<p>"Are you mad?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then of what do you accuse her?"</p>

<p>"She is a witch."</p>

<p>At this awful accusation both Charles and Cora<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
shrunk back in dismay, and for a moment neither
could speak; but Sarah Williams was not silent.
She continued upbraiding the unfortunate girl,
heaping charge upon charge on her innocent head,
until Cora felt as if she needs must sink beneath
the load.</p>

<p>"You have bewitched my cows; my sheep and
swine die mysteriously. Your form is seen oft at
night riding through the air. My poultry die
strangely and mysteriously, and my dog has fits.
Even my poor cat hath fallen under the evil spell
which you cast on all about me. Alas, Cora
Waters, you are bold and bad. Charles Stevens,
beware how you are seen about her, lest the wrath
that will fall upon her head involve you in ruin."</p>

<p>Cora Waters, leaning against a tree, covered her
face with her hands and murmured:</p>

<p>"Oh, God! wilt thou save me from the wrath of
these misguided people?"</p>

<p>"See how she blasphemes! For a witch to call
on the name of God is blasphemy of the very worst
kind. Away, witch!" and Sarah stamped her foot
in violence upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Stay, Cora!" Charles interposed, very calmly.
Then he turned upon Sarah Williams, and added:</p>

<p>"You accuse her falsely, Sarah. Beware how
you charge her of what the law makes a crime, or
you may have to answer in a court for slander."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Charles Stevens, beware how you defend the
being at your side. She is an imp of darkness,
and a day is coming when such will not be permitted
to run at large. Beware! <i>beware!</i> <span class="smcap">BEWARE!</span>"
and with the last command amounting almost
to a shriek, she turned about and ran away.</p>

<p>Long Charles Stevens stood gazing after the retreating
woman. The gentle breeze, stirring the
leaves of the sweet-scented forest, bore pleasant
odors to them, the birds sang their sweet peaceful
songs, while a squirrel, with a nut in its paws,
skipped nimbly over the leaves near and, pausing,
reared upon its hind legs and looked at them from
its bright little eyes, while the flowers nodded their
gaudy little heads as if to invite every one to be
glad; but Charles and Cora saw not all these beauties
of nature. She stood leaning against the friendly
trunk of a giant oak, and turned her eyes on him
with a look of helpless appeal and agony. He was
so dazed by the bold accusation, that he could not
speak for several seconds. She was first to regain
her speech.</p>

<p>"She, too, is my enemy."</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered.</p>

<p>"I have no friend&mdash;&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"Don't say that, Cora. While mother and I
live, you have two friends," he interrupted.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes; I had not forgotten you; but you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
may be powerless to aid me. I learned that they
were going to arrest and try some of the accused
people for witches. It is terrible," she added with
a shudder. "In England they burn witches at the
stake. My father saw one thus roasted. He said it
did touch him with tenderness to see the gallant way
she met her fate&mdash;cursing and reviling the hooting
mob gathered about her, whilst the angry flames,
leaping upward, licked her face, caught her locks,
crackling about her old gray head. I trow it was
a sorry sight, and God be praised, I never saw such
a one!"</p>

<p>"You never will, Cora, for those days are passed.
We live in a more enlightened and humane age.
People are not burned to death now, as they used
to be. We are safe under the shelter of humane
and wise laws."</p>

<p>Charles was mistaken. Human laws have never
been perfect or just, and mankind will never be safe
while laws are interpreted by partial magistrates.
Laws are never perfect, for, were they, continual
amendments would be unnecessary.</p>

<p>On their way home, Charles and Cora were compelled
to pass the Salem church. As they did so,
they met Mr. Parris face to face, as he was coming
out of the sanctuary whither he had gone to pray.
He paused near the door and, fixing his large gray
eyes on the unfortunate maid, glared at her much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
as an angry lion might gaze on the object of its
hatred; then he turned away on his heel with something
about the children of darkness profaning the
house of the Lord.</p>

<p>Cora shuddered as long as he was in sight, and
when he had disappeared, she said:</p>

<p>"Surely, he is a bad man!"</p>

<p>They resumed their walk to the house. Though
neither spoke, they went slowly, each buried in
thought. The gentle zephyrs, the frisking squirrels,
the nodding flowers, the singing birds, were all unheeded
by them. When the home was reached, he
found his mother standing in the door, her face almost
deathly white.</p>

<p>Though she said nothing, he knew she was
greatly disturbed. Her wheel stood idle, the great
heap of wool rolls lying unspun at the side of it.
She smiled faintly and, as Cora passed into the little
room set apart for her, turned her eyes anxiously to
her son.</p>

<p>"Mother, has any one been here since we left?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Was it Mr. Parris?"</p>

<p>"It was."</p>

<p>"We saw him come out of the church as we
passed."</p>

<p>"He was here but a moment since."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Charles felt that something had been said
to his mother to occasion alarm, and he asked her
what it was.</p>

<p>"He advised me to warn you to flee from the
wrath to come. He said you would be involved in
ruin ere you knew it, if you continued in your
present course."</p>

<p>"What did he mean?"</p>

<p>"He referred to her," and Mrs. Stevens significantly
nodded toward the apartment in which Cora
was. Charles had expected this answer. He went
slowly to the door and looked down the road to
see if the pastor was still in sight; but he was
not. Only the broad, well-beaten thoroughfare,
with the great, old trees standing on either side,
and the blue sea beyond the hill, with the village
in the valley were visible. The youth's heart was
full of bitterness, and the manner in which his
mother's words were spoken was not calculated to
allay the storm within his breast. Though her
words did not say so, her manner indicated that
she shared the opinions of Mr. Parris. Turning
from the door, Charles went toward her and said:</p>

<p>"Mother, whatever he said of her is false. I
know he hates Cora, that he would make her one
of the emissaries of Satan; but his charges are false.
You know&mdash;you must know that she is a pure,
good girl."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do know it," she answered, her face still
anxious and pale. "The accusation is false. I
know it is false; yet he threatens."</p>

<p>"Whom does he threaten?"</p>

<p>"You."</p>

<p>Charles laughed, as only a brave lad can laugh
at danger. Why need he fear Mr. Parris? Charles
was young and inexperienced. He knew not the
age in which he lived, and little did he dream of
the power which Mr. Parris, as pastor of the church,
could wield over the public. The pulpit controlled
judges and juries, law-makers and governors in that
day, and when an evil-disposed person like Mr.
Parris became pastor of a congregation, he could
wield a terrible influence.</p>

<p>"Mother, how can he injure me?" Charles asked.</p>

<p>"In more ways than one."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Charles; but I know&mdash;I feel that
something terrible is about to happen. Our people
will suffer from Mr. Parris&mdash;especially all who oppose
his ministry."</p>

<p>"I oppose his ministry, and I have no fear of
him. All he can do is to wound the feelings of
that poor girl; but she will go away soon, beyond
reach of his calumny."</p>

<p>"Heaven grant she may, and right soon, too."
As Charles was about to leave the house, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
mother asked: "Have you heard that Adelpha
Leisler from New York is coming?"</p>

<p>"Adelpha Leisler! No&mdash;&mdash;" He started, half
in joy and half in regret.</p>

<p>"She is. Surely, you have not forgotten her."</p>

<p>"No, mother. I will never forget the pretty
maid."</p>

<p>"Who, you said in your boyhood, was one day
to be your wife."</p>

<p>"Truly, I did. I have heard that Adelpha hath
kept the promise of early childhood to make a
beautiful woman. When will she come?"</p>

<p>"It is said she will be here before next Lord's
Day."</p>

<p>The expression of joy uttered in words, as well
as the glow which lighted up his countenance, was
seen by the white-faced young woman in the next
apartment. Cora was not an intentional eavesdropper.
Her door had been left accidentally ajar,
and when she heard the name Adelpha Leisler
spoken, she started to her feet, moved by a strange
impulse quite inexplicable to her. She had never
heard the name Adelpha Leisler before, and yet she
intuitively felt that the name had some terrible
bearing on her destiny. With loud beating heart,
lips parted and her whole being expressing pain,
she crouched close to the door and listened.</p>

<p>Jealousy, for the first time, entered the heart
of Cora Waters. Blessed is the being free from
this curse. The green-eyed monster, unbidden,
enters the heart and enthrones himself as ruler of
the happiness of the individual over whom it assumes
sway. She heard all that mother and son
said, and then watched him as he went out. Then
she closed the door of her apartment and retired to
her bedroom.</p>

<p>It was almost evening, and when Mrs. Stevens
informed her that tea was ready, she feigned headache
and asked to be excused. It was the heart
rather than the head that ached.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens was gathering in the herds as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
was the custom for the night, when he came rather
suddenly upon John Louder, returning from the
forest.</p>

<p>"Ho, Charles Stevens, where were you last Lord's
Day?" asked Louder.</p>

<p>"Was I missed?"</p>

<p>"You were, and I trow the patrol could not find
you."</p>

<p>"I was in Boston."</p>

<p>"Do you know that Mr. Parris hath begun to cry
out against some of the people?"</p>

<p>"I have heard as much, and I think the pastor
should be more careful, lest he will do an injustice."</p>

<p>Louder shook his head and, seating himself on
the green bank of a brooklet, answered:</p>

<p>"Goody Nurse is a witch. She hath grievously
tormented me on divers occasions and in divers
ways. Fain would I believe her other but I cannot."</p>

<p>"John Louder, you are a deceived and deluded
man."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, Charles, you mock me. I have
had her come and sit upon my chest and oppress
me greatly with her torments. Have I not been
turned into a beast and ridden through thorns and
briars at night and awoke to find myself in bed?"</p>

<p>Charles, laughing, answered:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was the troubled dream from which you
awoke."</p>

<p>"Nay; I found the thorns and briars pricking
my hands and legs."</p>

<p>"Perchance you walked in your sleep."</p>

<p>"Charles, why seek to deceive me in that way,
when I know full well that what I tell you is surely
truth? I see with my eyes, I hear with my ears,
and I feel with my senses. Only night before last,
I was ridden into a field where they partook of a
witches' sacrament."</p>

<p>"And what was it, pray?" asked Charles with a
smile of incredulity.</p>

<p>"The flesh and blood of a murdered victim."</p>

<p>Charles laughed outright.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, Charles, you need not laugh," cried
Louder, angrily. "She was there, too."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The maid who hath lived at your house. The
offspring of a vile player. Behold, I saw her partake
of the sacrament."</p>

<p>Charles Stevens' face alternately paled and
flushed as he answered:</p>

<p>"John Louder, you are the prince of liars, and
beware how you repeat your falsehoods, or I shall
crack your skull."</p>

<p>Louder, who was a coward, as well as superstitious,
had a wholesome dread of the stout youth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>He sprung back a few paces and stammered:</p>

<p>"No, no, I don't mean any harm. I&mdash;I am not
saying anything against you."</p>

<p>"John Louder, you are a notorious liar, and I
warn you to be careful in the future how your vile
tongue breathes calumny against innocent people.
Begone!"</p>

<p>Louder slowly rose and slunk away, and Charles
Stevens returned home. The evening air fanned
his heated brow, and he sought to cool his angry
temper before he reached home. The silent stars
watched the sullen youth who, pausing at the gate,
gazed in his helpless misery on the broad-faced
moon and murmured:</p>

<p>"How will all this end?"</p>

<p>It was his usual bedtime when Charles Stevens
entered the house, and his face was calm as a
summer sky over which a storm had never swept.
His mother was still plying her wheel, and the
heap of wool rolls had grown less and continued to
diminish. She asked her son no questions. He
sat down near the table, took up a book of psalms
and proceeded to read.</p>

<p>There was one in the next apartment who heard
him enter. It was Cora, and, rising, she crouched
near the door to listen. Perhaps they would say
something more of Adelpha Leisler; but he did not
mention her name again, and she almost hoped he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
cared nothing for her now, although he had confessed
that in his boyhood he had looked upon her
as his future wife. Almost every man selects his
wife in his early boyhood; but the child lover seldom
becomes the husband. The love of a play-mate,
tender as it may be, is not the love of maturity.
Cora strove to console herself with these thoughts;
but there was another danger that would obtrude
itself in her way. That was the knowledge that
he had not seen Adelpha for years, and she had
developed from a child to a beautiful woman.
Long she sat near the door, feeling decidedly guilty
at playing the part of an eavesdropper; but when
Charles rose, closed his book and went to his room,
and the mother put away her work, Cora rose and
went to her bed. Despite her sorrow and mental
worry, she had sweet dreams. Somebody, who
was Charles, appeared to her in light, and she rose
with the sun in her eyes, which at first produced
the effect of a continuation of her dream. Her
first thought on coming out of the dream was of a
smiling nature, and she felt quite reassured. The
dream had been so pleasant and sweet; life seemed
so peaceful and full of hope; nature smiled so
brightly on this holy morn, that she almost forgot
the hot words of the pastor and her jealousy of the
night before. She began hoping with all her
strength, without knowing why, and suffered from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
a contraction of the heart. It was a bright day;
but the sunbeam was still nearly horizontal, so she
reasoned that it was quite early; but she thought
she ought to rise in order to assist Charles' mother
in her household duties. She would see Charles
himself, feel the warmth of his glance and hear the
music of his voice. No objection was admissible;
all was certain. It was monstrous enough to have
suffered the pangs of jealousy on the night before;
but now that the bright dreams and glorious dawn
had dispelled these, she felt sure that good news
had come at last. Youth is so constituted, that it
quickly wipes its tears away, for it is natural for
youth to be happy, while its breath is made up of
hope.</p>

<p>Cora could not have recalled a single instance in
which Charles Stevens had uttered a word of hope or
encouragement to her. Her thoughts seemed to
play at hide and seek in her brain, and she was so
strangely, peculiarly happy this morning, that she
preferred to enjoy the revels of day-dreams to the
realities of life. Leaving her bed, she bathed her
face and said her prayers.</p>

<p>Voices were heard without, and she listened.
One was the well beloved voice of Charles Stevens.
He was speaking with some one, whom she rightly
guessed had just arrived. The voice of the new-comer
was too far distant for her to recognize it at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
first: but her eye, glancing through the lattice, descried
the form of a man coming toward the house.
That tall form, with thin, cadaverous features
and stern, unbending eye, was the man who had
publicly condemned her and held her up to the
scorn of the whole congregation, because she was
the child of a player. Cora did not hate him, for
she was too pure, too good, too heavenly to hate
even the man who had declared her to be a firebrand
of perdition. What was his object this
lovely morn? His appearance dispelled all the rosy
dreams and once more plunged her into that horrible,
oppressive gloom, which seemed heavier than
lead upon her heart.</p>

<p>"You are abroad early, this morning, Mr. Parris,"
Charles answered to the minister's morning
greeting.</p>

<p>"Not too soon, however," the reverend gentleman
answered. "The devil does not sleep. He
is abroad continually, and, verily, one needs must
rise early to be before him and his minions."</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Mr. Parris?" asked the
youth.</p>

<p>"I am coming here."</p>

<p>"Your call is early."</p>

<p>"Not earlier than Satan's. I trow he is here
even already and hath abided with you, before I
came."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>Charles made no answer to this, for there is no
wrath like the wrath of an angry preacher, whose
zeal warps his judgment and makes a fanatic of
him. Bigoted, tyrannical, haughty and cruel,
Parris swooped down on his enemies with the fury
of an eagle.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens was a little amazed at the manner
of the minister and asked:</p>

<p>"Is your business with me?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"It seems best that we converse where there is no
danger of being overheard, Charles, as what I have
to say is of a very grave and serious nature and
concerns your soul's welfare."</p>

<p>When a bigoted, ambitious zealot becomes interested
in the welfare of a person, that person is
in danger.</p>

<p>The anxious girl, whose face was pressed close
to the window lattice watching the men, heard all
and turned so pale, that even the warm rays of the
sun failed to give the tint and glow of life to the
cheek. She saw them walk away down the path
and go across the brook among the trees and over
the distant hill.</p>

<p>To Charles, it was like making a pilgrimage to
some place of evil, the end of which he dreaded.
Across the hill, hidden from the town by trees and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
intervening slope, they paused near the corner of a
stone fence, and Mr. Parris leaned against the wall
and gazed on Charles in silence.</p>

<p>"What have you to say, Mr. Parris?" the young
man asked, as the cold, gray eye, like a gleam of
steel fell upon him. Mr. Parris, in slow and
measured tones, answered:</p>

<p>"No man knows until the time comes what depths
are within him. To some men it never comes.
Let them rest and be thankful. To me it was
brought&mdash;it was forced upon me. I am despised,
misused and abused by the world for the fact that
I stand in the hand of God to do his holy will."</p>

<p>"You talk strangely, Mr. Parris," said Charles,
when the wild-eyed fanatic had finished and turned
his haggard face up toward heaven. "I think
your earnestness and zeal are mistaken."</p>

<p>"Yes, mistaken by all; but I know the Lord ordains
me for this good and holy work, and I will
serve my Master, hard as the task may be."</p>

<p>"Mr. Parris, may we not be mistaken in what
constitutes the service of the Master?"</p>

<p>"Aye! Is not the way so plain that a wayfaring
man, though a fool, cannot err therein?"</p>

<p>"Yet, 'they shall put you out of the synagogues;
yea, the time cometh that whosoever killeth you
will think that he doeth God service.' The great
question to decide is which is right. 'Not every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
one that saith Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom
of heaven.'"</p>

<p>"I am right!" cried Mr. Parris, his face flaming
with passion.</p>

<p>"So Melendez believed, when he drenched the
soil of Fort Carolinia with the blood of innocent
women and children."</p>

<p>"Young man, I am the preacher, not you. It
is for me to speak and you to listen. Satan has
been unchained, and the air is full of evil spirits."</p>

<p>"Mr. Parris, I have heard enough. Let me stop
you here. It will be better for you and better for
me. Let me go home."</p>

<p>"Not yet. The Lord commands, and it must
and shall be spoken. I have been in torments ever
since I stopped short of it before. Look not amazed
nor alarmed when I tell you that the day of the
wrath of the Lord is coming, and the minions of
hell that torment this accursed land will be gathered
into the fires of destruction. Charles, forgive this
earnestness, it is for your sake. It is another of
my miseries. I cannot speak on that subject nor
of that subject without stumbling at every syllable,
unless I let go my check and run mad;" and as
Charles Stevens gazed into those wild eyes and
hollow cheeks, he thought the man must already be
mad.</p>

<p>"Let us return home, Mr. Parris. Take another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
day to think, before you give expression to
what you would say."</p>

<p>"No, no; you must hear me now! Here is a
man driving his cows forth to graze. He will be
gone directly. I entreat you let us walk down the
road and return, for what I would say, Charles,
must be for your ears alone."</p>

<p>He yielded to the entreaty. How could he do
otherwise, for there could be no harm in walking
with the pastor? Mr. Parris, among his other accomplishments,
had the power of dissembling. He
could assume a smiling exterior while a devil raged
in his heart. After they had gone aside some distance,
and the farmer had passed on with his cows,
they returned to the old stone wall, and Charles
waited, very much as a criminal might, who stood
to receive his sentence.</p>

<p>"You know what I am going to say," the pastor
began, his austere face once more assuming its
terrible expression. "You don't like me, your
mother don't like me, and the congregation is divided,
doing all in their power to dispossess me;
but I am right. What other men may mean when
they use that expression, I cannot tell. What I
mean is that I am under the influence of some tremendous
power, which I know is God Almighty,
Himself, and resist that power I dare not. I may
be called a fanatic, cruel, mad; but the great and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
good God who made me ordains me in all things.
This power&mdash;this spirit&mdash;this will, whatever it may
be, is the chief motive that moves me. It could
draw me to fire; it could draw me to water; it
could draw me to the rack, as it did martyrs of
old; it could draw me to any death&mdash;to anything
pleasing, or repulsive; but I am mistaken, misunderstood
by people, and the future as well as the
present generation may condemn me in their narrow
views as being dishonest, as being revengeful,
as being even bloodthirsty; but, Charles, when
God did command Peter to slay, did he refuse?
No. If my God commands me to slay, I will do
it, though rivers of blood shall flow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The face of the wild fanatic was terrible to look
upon. Charles Stevens, bold as he was, gazing on
him in the full light of day, could not repress
a shudder. His thin, cadaverous face, smooth
shaven and of an ashen hue, was upturned to
heaven, and those great, awful eyes seemed gazing
on things unlawful for man to see. The long right
arm was raised toward the sky, and again that deep
voice called out:</p>

<p>"O thou great Jehovah, do but command me,
and rivers of blood shall flow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Parris!" began Charles, alarmed.</p>

<p>"Stop! I implore you do not interrupt me,
Charles. Wait until, by fasting and prayer and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
long, solemn meditation on these mysterious subjects,
the Lord has opened your eyes to the invisible
world, then you may judge. If you become
weary with long standing, sit down, and I will
pour into your ears such proofs that you can no
longer deny the existence of witchcraft."</p>

<p>Charles felt the strange spell of the fanatic's
presence, and he merely bowed his head as a signal
for him to proceed. Mr. Parris, in his deep
sepulchral voice, continued:<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Like argument is used by Cotton Mather in his "Invisible
World."</p></div>

<p>"Mr. John Higginson, that reverend and excellent
person, says that the Indians, which came
from far to settle about Mexico, were, in their progress
to that settlement, under a conduct of a Devil,
very strangely emulating the blessed covenant
which God gave Israel in the wilderness. Acosta
says that the Devil, in their idol Vitzlipultzli, governed
that mighty nation. He commanded them
to leave their country, promising to make them
lords over all the provinces possessed by six other
nations of Indians, and give them a land abounding
with all precious things. They went forth, carrying
their idol with them in a coffer of reeds, supported
by four of their principal priests, with whom
he still discoursed in secret, revealing to them the
successes and accidents of their way. He advised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
them when to march and where to stay, and, without
his command, they moved not. The first thing
they did wherever they came, was to erect a tabernacle
for their false god, which they always set in
the midst of their camp, and they placed the ark
upon an altar. When, wearied with the pains and
fatigues of travel, they talked of proceeding no
further in their journey than a certain pleasant stage,
whereto they were arrived, the Devil, in one night,
horribly killed the ones who had started this talk
by pulling out their hearts, and so they passed on
till they came to Mexico.</p>

<p>"The same Devil, which then thus imitated
what was in the church of the Old Testament, now
among us, would imitate the affairs of the church
in the New. The witches do say that they form
themselves after the manner of Congregational
Churches, and that they have baptism and a supper
and officers among them, abominably resembling
those of our Lord. What is their striking down
with a fierce look? What is their making of the
afflicted rise with a touch of their hand? What is
their transportation through the air? What is their
travelling in spirit, while their body is cast into a
trance? What is their causing cattle to run mad
and perish? What is their entering their names in
a book, their coming together from all parts at the
sound of a trumpet, their appearing sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
clothed with light and fire upon them, then covering
themselves and their instruments with invisibility?
Are not all these but a blasphemous imitation
of certain things recorded about our Saviour,
or his prophets, or the saints in the kingdom of
God?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Parris," said Charles, when the fanatic had
paused in his wild harangue for want of breath,
"you seem in earnest; but you must bear in mind
that there is a mistaken zeal&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold, Charles, I know what you would say;
but God has opened my eyes to the abominations
of witchcraft."</p>

<p>"So Bishop Mendoza thought, when he ordered
the innocent slain. Beware of false prophets, Mr.
Parris. They are more to be dreaded than the
protean devil of which you speak. Be sure that
you remove the beam from your own eye, before
you try to see the mote in the eye of your brother."</p>

<p>The sallow face of the fanatic grew more ghastly
than before. His teeth gnashed, and his great
eyes seemed starting in hatred from his head.
Seizing the wrist of Charles with his hand, he
clutched it so tightly as to almost make him cry
out in pain.</p>

<p>"Charles, Charles, why persecutest thou me?
Have not the scales of infidelity fallen from your
eyes? Would you deny the power of God?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>Charles Stevens, by an effort, freed his hand
and, with a boldness which increased as he spoke,
answered:</p>

<p>"It is not God whom I deny, but man. God is
good and just and kind. He who, in the name of
the Lord, would pervert His holy word is an impostor
and blasphemer more base than a thief or an
infidel."</p>

<p>"Charles, beware!"</p>

<p>"I have listened patiently to you, Mr. Parris.
Now listen to me. Where do you find in Scripture
justification for the charges you lay at the doors
of innocent people such as Goody Nurse, Goody
Easty, Goody Cloyse and the poor little maid Cora
Waters? What harm have they ever done you,
that you, as a Christian man, might not forgive
them?"</p>

<p>"Charles&mdash;&mdash;" interrupted Mr. Parris.</p>

<p>"Hold, sir; you shall hear me through. Mr.
Parris, you must be a man of singular shamelessness,
craft, ruthlessness and impudence, withal.
You began your operations with sharp bargaining
about your stipend and sharp practice in appropriating
the house and land assigned for the use
of successive pastors. You wrought so diligently,
under the stimulus of your ambition, that you
have got the meeting-house sanctioned as a true
church and yourself ordained as the first pastor of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Salem Village. Because you were opposed by
Goody Nurse, her sisters and others, you seek to
charge them with offences made punishable under
our laws with death."</p>

<p>The sallow face of the pastor grew almost white;
but, in a voice of forced calmness, he said:</p>

<p>"Go on&mdash;go on!"</p>

<p>"No; it is for you to tell, without further
discussion, why you brought me here. Rather
let me guess it. You have brought me to say
something to me about Cora Waters. You have
come to tell me she is a witch, and I tell you it is
false."</p>

<p>The passionate minister glared at the youth for
a moment and said:</p>

<p>"Charles, do you deny that she is the child of a
player?"</p>

<p>"I do not; but what sin follows being the child
of a player, or being even a player? Nowhere
does the Bible condemn the actor for his profession;
and, if the player be godly, his calling is
unobjectionable. Oh, Mr. Parris, eradicate from
your heart the deadly poison of prejudice, and
there will appear no harm in that fair, innocent
and much-abused young maid. She has ever been
a child of sorrow and of tears, one who never in
thought wronged any one. Tell me that child is a
witch? Mr. Parris, it is false!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

</div>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">"Then you may both go down&mdash;down to the infernal regions together!"</span></p>

<p>"Then," cried the pastor, suddenly changing
his tone, turning to Charles, and bringing his
clenched hand down upon the stone fence with a
force that laid the
knuckles raw and
bleeding; "then
you may both go
down&mdash;down to
the infernal regions
together!"
The dark look of hatred and revenge with which
the words broke from his livid lips, and with
which he stood holding out his bruised and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
bleeding hand, made Charles shudder and turn to
go home; but the pastor caught his arm.</p>

<p>"Mr. Parris, let me go. I have heard quite
enough. We understand each other thoroughly."</p>

<p>"And you will not give her up?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Verily, she hath bewitched you."</p>

<p>"I do not believe in witchcraft."</p>

<p>"What! Do you deny the word of God? Have
a care! You are going too far in this. And your
mother?"</p>

<p>"She does not believe in it, either."</p>

<p>"Charles, why have you and your mother grievously
opposed me?" he demanded, his eyes glaring
with hatred and his breath coming hard, while a
white froth, tinged with blood, exuded from his
lips.</p>

<p>"Because you are a bad man, Mr. Parris," cried
Charles. "You are a saintly fraud."</p>

<p>The rage of the pastor knew no bounds. Pointing
his wounded and bleeding hand at Charles, he
cried:</p>

<p>"Go! and may the curse of an outraged God go
with you!"</p>

<p>Charles went home.</p>

<p>There are moments in every life when the soul
hovers on some dark brink. It may be the brink
of atheism, of despair, of crime, or superstition.
Outside influences go far toward impelling life's
voyager on his course. If the current takes a sudden
turn, it bears him in a different direction from
which he had intended. The human mind is inexplicable.
It is not a machine that can be taken
apart and analyzed. It is not material that can be
grasped and comprehended. It is that mysterious
knowing, feeling and willing, independent of circumstances;
that immortal, indestructible portion
of man called soul. It is governed by no known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
laws, and at times seems to assume all the caprices
of chance.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens was a youth of good strong, common
sense; yet he could but feel strangely impressed
by the words and the awful look of Mr.
Parris. The man was surely more than mortal.
His voice, hollow and sepulchral, seemed to issue
from the tomb. His thin, cadaverous face was
sufficient in itself to inspire wonder. Those great,
blazing eyes had within them all the fires of lunacy,
fanaticism and cunning. Mr. Parris was nothing
more than an unscrupulous bigot. He was ambitious,
as is proven by his machinations in getting
himself declared the pastor of Salem. He was
greedy, as is shown by his taking the parsonage
and lands as well as demanding an increase in his
stipend. He was revengeful, as is shown by the
way in which he persecuted those who opposed him.
He was unscrupulous in his methods, as is proven
in the means he employed. He was filled with
prejudice, as is shown in his assailing Cora Waters,
because her father was an actor; yet Mr. Parris believed
himself a righteous and holy man, walking
in the path of the just.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens failed to tell his mother of the
strange interview with the pastor, somehow he
could not. He unaccountably shuddered when he
thought of it, and, despite the fact that he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
little superstition in his composition, he felt at
times a strange instinctive dread at the awful warning
of the pastor.</p>

<p>Since the evening on which the name of Adelpha
Leisler had been mentioned, Cora Waters had been
strangely shy and reticent, so that Charles Stevens
could not tell her of the interview with Mr. Parris,
even if he would. Cora was a remarkable girl.
She united in the highest perfection the rarest of
earthly gifts&mdash;genius and beauty. No one possesses
superior intellectual qualities without knowing
it. The alliteration of modesty and merit is
pretty enough; but where merit is great, the veil
of that modesty never disguises its extent from its
possessor. It is the proud consciousness of rare
qualities, not to be revealed to the every-day world,
that gives to genius that shy, reserved and troubled
air, which puzzles and flatters you, when you encounter
it. Cora realized her beauty and genius;
but, with that charming versatility, that of right
belongs to woman, she had the faculty of bending
and modelling her graceful intellect to all whom she
met.</p>

<p>Her rare genius, however, could not brook the
cold reproofs of the bigoted Parris. The flower
which might have ornamented his chapel and filled
the little church with sweetest perfume was withered
by the chilling frosts of bigotry and prejudice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
A player could yield no perfume for Christ, and
the sweet, musical voice was stilled, and the heart
so full of love, emotion and religion was chilled
and driven into exile; but she lived and hoped in
her own little world. The sunlight of love was on
her heart, until the name of Adelpha Leisler shut
out that sunlight and left all in darkness and despair.</p>

<p>Though Cora was excommunicated for being the
child of a player, she never let go her hold on
Christ. Her father, strolling actor as he was, had
taught her to look to God for everything, and in
her hour of trial, she knelt in the seclusion of her
own room and prayed that this cup might pass from
her lips, if it be the Lord's will; but if not, she
asked God to give her strength to bear her suffering
and trials. She freely forgave Mr. Parris, for she
believed his persecution of herself and others was
through mistaken zeal.</p>

<p>With Charles Stevens, she was more shy than
she used to be. She kept aloof from him for two
or three days, until her conduct became noticeable,
and Charles one day sought her in the garden for an
explanation.</p>

<p>"Have I offended you, Cora?" he asked.</p>

<p>She turned her frightened eyes to his for a moment
and answered:</p>

<p>"No."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then why do you avoid me? I have scarcely
seen you for three days."</p>

<p>She was overwhelmed with hope and confusion
for some moments; then, with a faltering voice,
she asked:</p>

<p>"Did you wish to see me?"</p>

<p>"I did, Cora. I would not give offence to you
for the world, and I feared I had in some way
wounded your feelings."</p>

<p>"Charles, was not Mr. Parris here the other
morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You went away with him; I saw you through
my window."</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Why did he come?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me about that man. He is one
whom I would to God I had never known."</p>

<p>"Don't speak so of him, Charles."</p>

<p>"Cora, he is a bad man."</p>

<p>"He is the pastor."</p>

<p>"For all that, he is cruel and bloodthirsty. I
know it. I feel it."</p>

<p>Cora shuddered and made a feeble effort to defend
the pastor who had persecuted her; but
Charles, who had the retaliating spirit of humanity
in his soul, declared he was a pious fraud and a
disgrace to his cloth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>On their return to the house, Mrs. Stevens met
them at the door with a glad smile on her face, and
cried:</p>

<p>"She has come, Charles."</p>

<p>"Who?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Adelpha Leisler."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stevens saw an immediate change in the
face of Cora. The features which had begun to
glow with happiness suddenly grew sad and
clouded, and the eyes drooped. Charles did not
perceive that sudden change so apparent to his
mother, for, at the announcement of the arrival of
one whom he had known in his happy childhood
days, his heart bounded with joy.</p>

<p>"Where is she, mother?"</p>

<p>"With Goody Nurse."</p>

<p>He hastily took leave of Cora, who, with an oppressive
weight on her heart, which seemed to almost
suffocate her, went to the little room in
which she had known so much joy and misery.
All was dark now. Her heart vibrated painfully
in her breast. Hope and joy seemed forever
banished. He was gone. She could hear
his footsteps moving away from the house, and,
throwing herself on the couch, she gave way to
a fit of weeping. Never did Cora Waters so feel
her utter insignificance and loneliness. She was
a child of an indented slave, utterly dependent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
on the one whom she had had the audacity to
love.</p>

<p>When she realized how unworthy she was, the
unfortunate girl sobbed, half aloud:</p>

<p>"Oh, God, why didst thou create me with desires
and ambitions above my sphere? Why didst
thou cast me into this place, where I would meet
him, only to suffer? Father, father, come and
take me hence!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Charles Stevens, unconscious of her
suffering, was hurrying as rapidly as he could to
the home of Goody Nurse, where he was to meet
Adelpha Leisler. He reached the house and was
greeted by a tall, beautiful young woman, with
great, black eyes and hair.</p>

<p>The greeting she gave him was warm, almost
ardent, for, although Adelpha was an accomplished
young lady, she had all of the genial warmth of
youth. They were soon talking pleasantly of those
happy days of long ago.</p>

<p>Glorious past, gone like a golden dream to return
no more! The very memory of such pleasure
produces pain, because it is forever gone. Great
changes had come since last they met. His father
was living then, a handsome, strong man, noted
for his kindness of heart. Many friends, who
now existed only in pleasant remembrance, then
lived, breathed and moved upon the earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Then he loved Adelpha, and she loved him,
and he half hoped that this meeting in mature
life would reproduce the pleasant sensations of
childhood; but there is a love which is not the love
of the thoughtless and the young&mdash;a love which
sees not with the eyes and hears not with the ears,
but in which soul is enamoured of soul. The cave-nursed
Plato dreamed of such a love. His followers
sought to imitate it; but it is a love that is not
for the multitude to echo. It is a love which only
high and noble natures can conceive, and it has
nothing in common with the sympathies and ties
of coarse affections. Wrinkles do not revolt it.
Homeliness of features do not deter it. It demands
youth only in the freshness of emotions. It requires
only the beauty of thought and spirit.</p>

<p>Such a love steals on when one least suspects and
takes possession of the soul. Such a love cannot
be uprooted by admiration or fancy. Charles
Stevens found Adelpha grown so beautiful, so
witty and accomplished, that he was awed in her
presence at first; but her freedom of manner removed
all restraint, and in an hour they seemed
transported back to childhood's happy hours.</p>

<p>Next day they wandered as they had done in
earlier years by purling streams and mossy banks,
under cool shadows of friendly trees. Every old
playground and hallowed spot was visited once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
more, and they lived over those joyous scenes of
childhood.</p>

<p>"I sometimes wish that childhood would last
forever," said Charles.</p>

<p>"Childhood brings its joys, but its sorrows as
well," Adelpha answered, as she sat on the mossy
bank at his side, her bright eyes on his face.
"One would grow weary of never advancing.
Don't you remember how, in your boyhood, you
looked forward with pleasure to the time when you
would be a man?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"And how you planned for a glorious future?"</p>

<p>"I remember it all."</p>

<p>"To doom you to perpetual childhood, to constantly
have those hopes of being a man blasted
would eventually bring you to endless misery.
No, Charles, childhood, to be happy and joyous,
must be brief. The youth with ambition longs to
enter man's estate. He sees life only in its rosiest
hues, and his hopes and anticipations form half his
happiness."</p>

<p>"Your words, Adelpha, teach me how foolish
and idle was my remark. Let us change the subject
to something more practical. Will your father,
as governor of New York, be disturbed?"</p>

<p>Her face grew sad.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have great fears."</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"Father and Jacob Milborne may be declared
usurpers."</p>

<p>"But it was on the accession of William and
Mary to the throne of England that your father
became governor."</p>

<p>"True. It was not until Andros had been
seized in Boston, imprisoned and sent to England,
that my father suggested the seizure of Fort James.
He was made commander and afterward governor,
and so holds his office to this day. I don't know
how William and Mary, our dread sovereigns,
will be affected by this seizure of the government
of New York."</p>

<p>"It was in their interest."</p>

<p>"It was so intended; but we have all learned
not to put our trust in princes. It is quite dangerous
to do so, and I sometimes fear that trouble
will come of it."</p>

<p>"Surely, Adelpha, one of your happy turn of
mind would not borrow trouble. It will come
quite soon enough without, and a philosopher would
wait until it comes rather than seek it."</p>

<p>"You are right, Charles; let us be young again,
romp in the wood, chase butterflies and forget the
dark clouds that may be hovering over us." She
started to her feet and asked: "Charles, who is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
that lovely, but shy young girl, whom I see hurrying
along the path?"</p>

<p>He looked in the direction indicated by Adelpha's
jewelled finger, and said:</p>

<p>"She is Cora Waters."</p>

<p>"And who is Cora Waters?"</p>

<p>"A very sweet and amiable girl tarrying here
for the present. Her father was a player, and he
became involved in the rebellion in England."</p>

<p>Charles did not care to tell all, for Cora was a
disagreeable subject to discuss with Adelpha; but
the companion of his childhood was not to be so
easily put off.</p>

<p>"Charles, she is very pretty. Why have you
not told me of her before?"</p>

<p>"I did not suppose you would be interested in
her," the young man answered.</p>

<p>"Not interested in her, with all the romance attached
to her. A child reared in old England, of
which I have heard so much, the daughter of a
player, perchance an actress herself. Oh, Charles,
I am very anxious to see her and talk with her."</p>

<p>"Adelpha, do you forget that she is a player?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; we descendants of the Netherlands
look on such things in a far different light from
the fanatical Puritans of New England. I must
know this Cora Waters."</p>

<p>"You shall."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>As Charles strolled away from the spring with
Adelpha, the face of Sarah Williams appeared
from behind some bushes. Her jet black eyes
flashed with fire, and her teeth gnashed until they
threatened to crack between her angry jaws.</p>

<p>"He hath another! Which of the two doth he
love most? I will know, and then&mdash;woe betide
her!"</p>

<p>Sarah Williams was cunning and utterly unscrupulous.
As she glared after Charles and
Adelpha, her fertile brain was forming a desperate,
wicked scheme. She watched them until they
disappeared over the hill, and then, turning about,
walked hurriedly to the parsonage.</p>

<p>Adelpha, who was a merry, light-hearted girl,
in love with all the world, insisted on forming the
acquaintance of Cora, until Charles, to gratify her,
granted her request, and the maids met. Cora was
distant and conventional, while Adelpha was warm-hearted
and genial. They came to like each other,
despite the fact that each looked on the other as a
rival.</p>

<p>Cora had given up Charles Stevens, realizing
that she was inferior and unworthy in every sense,
and certainly not capable of competing with the
daughter of the governor of New York. On the
other hand, Adelpha saw a dangerous rival in this
mysterious maid with eyes of blue and hair of gold;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
but Adelpha was honest and true, as were the old
Knickerbockers who followed her. She realized
the maid's power and, in her frank and open manner,
loved her rival. Despite the fact that they
were rivals, the girls became friends, and as
Adelpha had learned more of Cora's trials, she
gave her the full sympathy of her warm, loving
heart.</p>

<p>Sarah Williams, who watched them with no little
interest, asked herself:</p>

<p>"I know he loves both. Can a man wed two?
No; he must choose between the two, so I will
stand between."</p>

<p>Charles, on account of his superior education,
was regarded as an extraordinary personage. He
was gloomy and sad of late, for Sarah Williams,
with her keen woman's instinct, had probed his
secret. He was troubled to know which maid he
loved most.</p>

<p>Cora, with her melancholy beauty, appealed to
his strong emotions; but Adelpha, with her fine
figure, her great, dark, lustrous eyes and charming
manner, seemed equally attractive. If Cora were
the stream that ran deepest, Adelpha was the one
that sparkled brightest. At one moment he was
ready to avow his love for one, and the next moment
he was willing to swear eternal fealty to the
other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>Late one afternoon, he wandered with Cora at
his side across the flowery meadow to a point of
land presenting a grand and picturesque view of
green fields, blue hills and the distant sea. They
had come to watch the sunset, and Charles wished
to be alone with Cora, that he might sound the
depths of his heart and ask himself if he really
loved her.</p>

<p>Her father was to come in a few days and take
her away to the far-off wilderness, so, if he spoke
the promptings of his soul, he must do it now.
Long they sat on the grassy knoll and watched the
declining sun.</p>

<p>"How long have you known Adelpha?" Cora
asked.</p>

<p>"We were children together."</p>

<p>"Has she always lived in New York?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but our grandparents knew each other.
Matthew Stevens had a Dutch friend, Hans Van
Brunt, whom he met in Holland. When Van
Brunt emigrated to New Amsterdam and Matthew
Stevens to New Plymouth they renewed their
friendship. Their descendants have always kept
up the friendship. Matthew Stevens was my
grandfather, and Hans Van Brunt was Adelpha
Leisler's great-grandfather. When quite a child,
Adelpha's mother, the wife of a prosperous New
York merchant, spent a year in Boston where I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
lived. It was then Adelpha and I first became
acquainted."</p>

<p>Cora's eyes were on the distant blue hills; but
her thoughts seemed elsewhere. Charles would
have given much to have known what was in her
mind. Did she, in her heart, entertain hatred for
Adelpha? Her remark a moment later convinced
him to the contrary.</p>

<p>"Adelpha is a lovely maid and as good as she
is beautiful. Her lot is a happy one."</p>

<p>There was no bitterness, no regret in the remark;
yet her words were so sad, that they went to the
heart of Charles.</p>

<p>"Cora, there is such a difference in the lots of
people, that sometimes I almost believe God is unjust."</p>

<p>"Charles!" she cried, quite shocked.</p>

<p>"Hear me out, before you condemn me, Cora.
Here is Adelpha, who has known only sunshine
and happiness, health and prosperity. She was
born in a wealthy family, and has all the luxuries
that riches can buy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She is good and deserves them," interrupted
Cora. "God has rewarded her."</p>

<p>"But, on the other hand, you are just as good;
yet your life has been one of bitterness. Misery
seems to steal some people at their birth; but
sometimes there come changes in the lives of people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
All may run smoothly for a while, then
storms gather about the head of the child of fortune,
while, on the other hand, to one who has
fought and struggled through storms and adversity
a peaceful harbor may open&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cora suddenly said:</p>

<p>"God forbid, Charles, that our lots should be
reversed. I would not have Adelpha Leisler drain
the cup of bitterness, as I have done; but we must
change our subject, for, see there, Adelpha and
Alice Corey are coming."</p>

<p>He looked up and saw the two near at hand.</p>

<p>Alice Corey was a bright-eyed girl of fourteen,
a niece of Goody Nurse who had been accused of
witchcraft. She was a girl of a light and happy
disposition, and, as yet, cares sat lightly on her
brow.</p>

<p>"Watching the sunset, are you?" said Adelpha,
breathless with rapid walking.</p>

<p>"We have been," answered Charles.</p>

<p>"Well, it is a pretty thing to see, and I wish he
would always be setting," declared Alice Corey.</p>

<p>"A child's wish," answered Adelpha. "What
would become of your flowers?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know. I do so love that
red tinge over there, just where it touches the
gray."</p>

<p>"It is somewhat like that queer sea-shell which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
Cora showed me yesterday," said Adelpha.
"What splendid paints these mermaids must use,
down in their deep sea-caves! It is a kind that
does not rub off with wetting. The shells are their
pink saucers."</p>

<p>"What! Do they really paint?" cried the
credulous Alice.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens laughed softly and answered:</p>

<p>"No, child. You must not believe such stories.
I will tell you a prettier one if you'll listen."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll listen!" cried Alice, who, like all children,
was ever ready to give ears to a story.
Charles began:</p>

<p>"Once upon a time, long before Adam and Eve
lived, I believe it was, while the earth was young,
there lived on it a fair, radiant maiden, sweeter
than the breath of fresh-blown roses and more
lustrous than the morning star. All the world was
her own paradise, and she traversed it as she chose,
finding everywhere trees bearing golden fruit,
which never turned to ashes, flowers in perpetual
bloom, fountains that bubbled and birds that sang
in the linden groves, all for her. Nothing was
forbidden her. No cares, no fears, or griefs
marred her pleasures; for she had no law to consult
but her own wishes. When she would eat,
the trees bent down their boughs, and whispered,
'Choose my fruit.' When she would listen, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
birds vied with each other in their melodies.
When she would walk, the green sod was proud
to bear her, and, when weary, the gentlest flower-laden
zephyrs soothed her to rest. Thus she might
have remained always happy; but one day she
chanced to see herself in the water, and she thought
how every thing else was double. Then she became
conscious of a strange pain. Every thing
now lost its charm. She sought a companion; but
she could find none. Nothing was wanting but
the thing she most desired&mdash;the sight of her own
kin. At last, she instinctively felt that the burning
gaze of a lover was bent upon her face, and,
looking up, she saw only the sun in the sky, shining
as though myriads needed his light. 'Alas!'
she sighed, 'He is as lonely as I, and he shall be
my lover;' but the sun was coy and timid. He
gazed proudly at her from a great distance, and
veiled himself behind a cloud when she would see
him, that his brightness might not harm her; but
he never came nigh. At last, when she was worn
out with longing for a closer companionship, she
set out to find her adored sun; and as she sighed,
'Shall I find him never?' some one from a grotto
near by answered, 'Ever?' 'Who are you?' cried
the maid. 'I am a bodiless spirit,' was the answer,
'the voice of one that is gone. I tell impossible
things. I am the shadow of the past, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
substance of events to come. Man is a mocker.'
'Can you tell me where to find my lover?' asked
the maid. Echo told her not to look up for him,
for he was too high above her, not to seek him in
the east, for then he was hastening away; but to
seek him in the west, where he laid himself
and rested at night, for the night was made for
lovers. Then she hastened joyously, till she
came to the extreme west, to the very edge of the
world."</p>

<p>"How could she get to the edge, when it is
round?" interrupted Alice.</p>

<p>"Probably the world was not round at that
time," explained Adelpha.</p>

<p>Charles went on:</p>

<p>"The maid summoned all the powers of nature
and the air, and bade them build a palace. It
was not like other palaces. There were no jewels
there; but every thing was warm and crimson and
ruddy. The gates were parallel bars of cloud,
with the west wind for warden. Crystals of rain-drops
paved the court-yard. The architecture was
floating mists and delicate vapors, filled with a
silent music, that waited only for the warm touch
of the player to melt it into soul-subduing harmonies;
and along the galleries ran a netted fringe of
those tender whispers, which only the favored may
hear. So she built her palace and filled it with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
all things such as she thought the sun would like,
not forgetting an abundance of fire to warm him,
lest even her love would prove insufficient for one
of so fiery a nature. Then she dismissed her attendants
and sat down alone to wait his coming.
The day seemed long and drear and weary; but
she had seen him watching her, and he was coming
at last. Down the slope he glided, holding his
fiery steeds in check. There was joy for the desolate
one, for her lover was coming; but the pitiless
sun descended and swept by, scorning the open
gates, and her siren voice, that would have wooed
him thither. The next day passed, and the next,
and the next, and she was still disappointed; but
she could not believe that all her labor had been
in vain, and still she nursed her sickly, dying
hope. Though that sun has set thousands of times
since then, she hopes for their union still. In the
day time the palace is dark like the clouds; but,
as evening approaches, she lights it up for his
coming. Then we see those glorious tints of crimson
and gold and purple and dun, dimming till
they mingle with the white clouds above, and, were
we near enough, we might possibly hear the tones
of the reviving music, as it melts; but as the sun
goes fairly down, the music hushes, the beautiful
tints fade and die, the palace becomes a dark spot
again, and the poor little watcher within sighs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
forth her disappointment and composes herself to
wait for another sunset."</p>

<p>"I don't believe your story, Charles Stevens,"
said Alice, at the conclusion, "and I don't see
what good it does, anyhow, to make up such a
one as that."</p>

<p>"The moral in it is man's faithlessness and woman's
constancy," put in Cora Waters, who had,
for a long time, been silent.</p>

<p>Adelpha, who had watched the sun sink beneath
the distant blue hills, as she listened to Charles, now
chanced to glance over her shoulder at the sea behind,
with the moon just rising above the watery horizon,
and with a merry peal of laughter she added:</p>

<p>"Charles, your heroine is more dull than modern
maids, or, when the sun jilted her, she would have
wooed the moon."</p>

<p>Alice, rising, said, "It is growing dark. Let
us go home."</p>

<p>"Alice, are you afraid of the witches, which
seem to disturb Mr. Parris and Cotton Mather?"
asked Adelpha.</p>

<p>"There are no witches," Alice Corey answered
with a shudder. "Father and mother both deny
that there are any witches, and it is wrong to cry
out against my aunt, Goody Nurse."</p>

<p>"I dare say it is. The evening grows chill.
Let us go home."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>As the four wended their way across the fields
and meadows, Charles Stevens, who walked between
Cora and Adelpha, cast alternately furtive
glances at each, sorely troubled to decide which
he liked best.</p>

<p>"Both are beautiful," he thought. "Ere long
I must wed, and which of the twain shall it be?
Both are beautiful, and both are good; but, unfortunately,
they are two, and I am one."</p>

<p>The child, who had lingered behind to pluck a
wild flower, at this moment came running after
them, calling:</p>

<p>"Wait! wait! I implore you, wait for me!"</p>

<p>"What have you seen, Alice?"</p>

<p>"A black woman."</p>

<p>The girls were almost ready to faint; but
Charles, who was above superstition, bade them be
calm and hurried through the deepening shades of
twilight to the trees on the hill where the woman
had been seen. He came in sight of the figure of
a woman clothed in black, sitting at the root of an
oak.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked, advancing toward
her.</p>

<p>"Charles Stevens!" she gasped, raising her head.</p>

<p>"Sarah Williams, what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Prythee, what are you doing?" she asked.</p>

<p>"This is unaccountable."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>She rose and, turning her white face to him,
said:</p>

<p>"Charles Stevens, which of the twain do you
love best?" and she pointed to Cora and Adelpha.
He made no answer. "Which of the twain is it?"
she repeated. "Aye, Charles Stevens, you shall
never wed either. Do you hear?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 618px;">

</div>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">"Which of the twain shall it be?"</span></p>

<p>"Woman, what mean you?"</p>

<p>"You cannot decide which you love most.
Wed neither, Charles. Wed me!"</p>

<p>"You!" he cried, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, why not?"</p>

<p>"You already have a husband."</p>

<p>"No; he is dead, he was lost at sea. I am still
young and fair, and wherefore not choose me?"</p>

<p>Charles Stevens burst into a laugh, half merriment
and half disgust, and turned from the bold,
scheming woman. She followed him for a few
paces, saying in tones low but deep:</p>

<p>"Verily, Charles Stevens, you scorn me; but I
will yet make you repent that you ever treated my
love with contempt. You shall rue this day."</p>

<p>He hurried away from the annoyance, treating
her threats lightly, and little dreaming that they
would be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Winter came and passed, and Adelpha Leisler
still lingered at Salem. Rumors of trouble came
to her ears from home; but the light-hearted girl
gave them little thought. One morning in May,
1691, Charles met her coming to seek him. Her
face was deathly white, and her frame trembling.</p>

<p>"What has happened, Adelpha?"</p>

<p>"There is trouble at home, Charles," she cried.
"Father and Milborne have been arrested and
imprisoned and I fear it will fare hard with them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
I want to set out for New York at once. Will
you accompany me?"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>They found his mother and Cora and told them
all. He implored Cora to remain with his mother,
until he returned, which she consented to do.</p>

<p>In order to explain the sudden danger which
menaced the father of Adelpha Leisler, and which
she, like a true, heroic daughter, hastened to brave,
we will be compelled to narrate some events in our
story of a historical nature. Jacob Leisler was an
influential colonist of an old Dutch family, as has
been stated, and a Presbyterian.</p>

<p>Under the reign of James II. the Presbyterians
had suffered, and no one rejoiced more at the accession
of William and Mary than did the Dutch
of New York.</p>

<p>Sir Edmond Andros, the weak tool of the Duke
of York, had rendered himself decidedly unpopular
as governor of New York, Connecticut and
Massachusetts. Every one rejoiced when he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
finally arrested at Boston and sent to England, and
no one rejoiced more than the New Yorkers themselves.</p>

<p>The accession of William and Mary to the throne
of England was hailed with joy throughout the
American Colonies. In New York, a general disaffection
to the government prevailed among the
people. Under the smiles of Governor Andros,
papists began to settle in the colony. The collector
of the revenues and several principal officers of
King James threw off the mask and openly avowed
their attachment to the doctrines of Rome. A
Latin school was set up, and the teacher was
strongly suspected of being a Jesuit. The people
of Long Island were disappointed in their expectations
of the favors promised by the governor on his
arrival, and became his personal enemies, and in a
word the whole body of the people had begun to
tremble for the Protestant cause.</p>

<p>Here the leaven of opposition first began to work.
Intelligence from England of the designs there
in favor of Orange elevated the hopes of the disaffected;
but until after the rupture in Boston, no
man dared to act. Sir Edmond Andros, who was
perfectly devoted to the arbitrary measures of King
James, by his tyranny in New England had drawn
upon himself the universal odium of a people animated
with a love of liberty, and in the defense of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
it resolute and courageous. Therefore, when unable
longer to endure his despotic rule, he was
seized, imprisoned and afterward sent to England as
has been stated. The government was, in the
meantime, vested in a committee of safety, of which
Mr. Bradstreet was chosen president.</p>

<p>Already, information of the popular uprising in
England for the Prince of Orange had reached New
York and was stirring the blood of the progenitors
of the old Knickerbockers, who longed to have their
own beloved prince with them. On receiving news
of the arrest of the detested Andros, several captains
of the New York militia convened themselves
to concert measures in favor of the Prince of
Orange. Among them was Jacob Leisler, Adelpha's
father, who was most active of all. He was a
man of wealth and considerable esteem among the
people, but destitute of the qualifications essential
to such an enterprise. His son-in-law, Milborne,
a shrewd Englishman, directed all his councils,
while Leisler as absolutely influenced the other
officers.</p>

<p>The first thing they contrived was to seize the
garrison of New York; and the custom, at that
time, of guarding it every night by militia gave
Leisler a fine opportunity of executing the design.
He entered it with forty-nine men and determined
to hold it till the whole militia should join him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
Colonel Dougan, who was about to leave the province,
then lay embarked in the bay, having a little
before resigned the government to Francis Nicholson,
the lieutenant-governor. The council, civil
officers and magistrates of the city were against
Leisler, and therefore many of his friends were at
first fearful of espousing a cause opposed by so
many noted gentlemen. For this reason, Leisler's
first declaration in favor of the Prince of Orange
was subscribed by only a few among several
companies of the train-bands. While the people,
for four successive days, were in the utmost perplexity
to determine what party to choose, being
solicited by Leisler on the one hand and threatened
by the lieutenant-governor on the other, the
town was alarmed with a report that three ships
were coming up with orders from the Prince of
Orange. This report, though false, served to further
the interests of Leisler; for on that day, June
3d, 1689, his party was augmented by the addition
of six captains and four hundred men in New
York and a company of seventy men from East
Chester, who all subscribed a second declaration,
mutually covenanting to hold the fort for that
prince. Until this time, Colonel Dougan continued
in the harbor, waiting the issues of these commotions,
and Nicholson's party, being unable
longer to contend with their opponents, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
totally dispersed, the lieutenant-governor himself
absconding on the very night after the declaration
was signed.</p>

<p>Leisler, being in complete possession of the fort,
sent home an address to King William and Queen
Mary, as soon as he received the news of their accession
to the throne. The address was a tedious,
incorrect, ill-drawn narrative of the grievances
which the people had endured and the methods
lately taken to secure themselves, ending with a
recognition of the king and queen over the whole
English dominion. This address was soon followed
by a private letter from Leisler to King
William, which, in very broken English, informed
his majesty of the state of the garrison, the repairs
he had made to it, and the temper of the people,
and concluded with a strong protestation of his
sincerity, loyalty and zeal.</p>

<p>Jost Stoll, an ensign, on delivering this letter,
had the honor to kiss his majesty's hand; but
Nicholson, the lieutenant-governor, and one Ennis,
an Episcopal clergyman, arrived in England before
him, and by falsely representing the late measures
in New York, as proceeding rather from their aversion
to the Church of England than zeal for the
Prince of Orange, Leisler and his party were deprived
of the rewards and notice which their activity
for the revolution justly warranted. Though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the king made Stoll the bearer of his thanks to the
people for their fidelity, he so little regarded
Leisler's complaints against Nicholson, that the
latter was soon after made the governor of Virginia,
while Dougan returned to Ireland and became
Earl of Limerick.</p>

<p>Leisler's sudden rise to supreme power over the
province, with fair prospects of King William's
approbation of his conduct, could but excite the
envy and jealousy of the late council and magistrates,
who had refused to join in aiding the revolution;
and hence the cause of all their aversion
both to the man and his measures. Colonel Bayard
and Courtland, the mayor of the city, headed the
opposition to Leisler, and, finding it impossible to
raise a party against him in the city, they very
early retired to Albany, and there endeavored to
foment the opposition. Leisler, fearful of their
influence, and to extinguish the jealousy of the
people, thought it prudent to admit several trusty
persons to a participation in that power which the
militia, on the first of July, had committed solely
to himself. In conjunction with these, who, after
the Boston example, were called the committee of
safety, he exercised the government, assuming to
himself only the honor of being president of their
councils.</p>

<p>This mode of government continued till the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
month of December, when a packet arrived with a
letter from the Lords Carmarthen, Halifax and
others, directed to "Francis Nicholson, esq., or,
in his absence, to such as, for the time being, take
care for preserving the peace and administering the
laws, in their majesty's province of New York,
in America." This letter was dated the 29th of
July and was accompanied by another from Lord
Nottingham, dated next day, which empowered
Nicholson to take upon him the chief command,
and to appoint for his assistance as many of the
principal freeholders and inhabitants, as he should
deem necessary, also requiring him "to do every
thing appertaining to the office of lieutenant-governor,
according to the laws and customs of New
York, until further orders."</p>

<p>As Nicholson had absconded before the letter
reached New York, Leisler considered the letter
as directed to himself, and from this time issued
all kinds of commissions in his own name, assuming
the title and authority of lieutenant-governor.
It was while he was thus acting as governor that
his daughter made a visit to Salem as was stated
in the preceding chapter. On the 11th of December,
he summoned the committee of safety and,
agreeably to their advice, swore in the following
persons for his council. "Peter De Lanoy, Samuel
Stoats, Hendrick Jansen and Johannes Vermilie,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
for New York; Gerardus Beekman, for King's
County; Thomas Williams for West Chester,
and William Lawrence, for Orange County."</p>

<p>Except the eastern inhabitants of Long Island,
all the southern part of the colony cheerfully acquiesced
to Leisler's command. The principal
freeholders, however, by respectful letters, gave
him hopes of their submission, and thereby prevented
his taking up arms against them, while
they were privately soliciting the colony of Connecticut
to take them under its jurisdiction. It
was not so much an aversion to Leisler's authority,
as a desire to unite with a people from whom they
had originally sprung, which prompted the Long
Islanders to desire a union with Connecticut, and
when Connecticut declined their offer of annexation,
they appeared to openly advocate Leisler's
cause.</p>

<p>At Albany, the people were determined to hold
the garrison and city for King William, independent
of Leisler, and on the 26th of October, before
the arrival of the packet from Lord Nottingham,
they formed themselves into a convention to resist
what they called the usurpation of Leisler. As
Leisler's attempt to reduce this country to his command
was the original cause of divisions in the
province, and in the end brought about the ruin of
himself and his son-in-law, it may not be out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
place here to give the resolution of the convention
at large, a copy of which was sent down to the
usurping governor.</p>

<p>"Peter Schuyler, mayor, Dirk Wessels, recorder,
Jan Wendal, Jan Jansen Bleeker, Claes Ripse,
David Schuyler, Albert Ryckman, aldermen, Killian
Van Rensselaer, justice, Captain Marte Gerritse,
justice, Captain Gerrit Teunisse, Dirk Teunisse,
justices, Lieutenant Robert Saunders, John
Cuyler, Gerrit Ryerse, Evert Banker, Rynier Barentse.</p>

<p>"Resolved: since we are informed by persons
coming from New York, that Captain Jacob Leisler
is designed to send up a company of armed men,
upon pretence to assist us in this country, who
intend to make themselves master of their majesties'
fort and this city, and carry divers persons
and chief officers of this city prisoners to New
York, and so disquiet and disturb their majesties'
liege people; that a letter be written to Alderman
Levinus Van Schaic, now at New York, and Lieutenant
Jochim Staets, to make narrow inquiry of
the business, and to signify to the said Leisler,
that we have received such information; and withal
acquaint him, that, notwithstanding we have the
assistance of ninety-five men from our neighbors
of New England, who are now gone for, and one
hundred men upon occasion, to command, from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
county of Ulster, which we think will be sufficient
this winter, yet we will willingly accept any such
assistance as they shall be pleased to send for the
defence of their majesties' county of Albany; provided
they be obedient to, and obey such orders
and commands as they shall, from time to time,
receive from the convention; and that by no means
they will be admitted to have the command of their
majesties' fort or this city; which we intend, by
God's assistance, to keep and preserve for the behoof
of their majesties, William and Mary, King
and Queen of England, as we hitherto have done
since their proclamation; and if you hear that they
persevere with such intentions, so to disturb the inhabitants
of this county, that you then, in the
name and behalf of the convention and inhabitants
of the city and county of Albany, protest against
the said Leisler, and all such persons that shall
make attempt for all losses, damages, bloodshed, or
whatsoever mischiefs may insue thereon; which you
are to communicate with all speed, as you perceive
their design."</p>

<p>Taking it for granted that Leisler at New York
and the convention at Albany were equally affected
by the revolution, nothing could be more egregiously
foolish than the conduct of both parties,
who, by their intestine divisions, threw the province
into convulsions, sowing the seeds of mutual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
hatred and animosity, which, for a long time after,
greatly embarrassed the public affairs of the colony.
When Albany declared for the Prince of Orange,
there was nothing else that Leisler could properly
require; and, rather than sacrifice the public peace
of the province to the trifling honor of resisting a
man who had no civil designs, Albany ought to
have delivered the garrison into his hands, until
the king's orders were received; but while Leisler
was intoxicated with his new-gotten power, Bayard,
Courtland and Schuyler, on the other hand could
not brook a submission to the authority of a man,
mean in his abilities and inferior in his degree.
Animated by these feelings both sides prepared
for hostilities. Mr. Livingston, a principal agent
for the convention, retired into Connecticut to solicit
aid for the protection of the frontier against
the French. Leisler, suspecting that these forces
were to be used against him, endeavored to have
Livingston arrested as an aider and abettor of the
French and the deposed King James.</p>

<p>The son-in-law of Leisler, Jacob Milborne, was
commissioned for the reduction of Albany. Upon
his arrival before the city, a great number of the
inhabitants armed themselves and repaired to the
fort, then commanded by Mr. Schuyler, while many
others followed the members of the convention to
a conference with him at the city hall. In order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
to win the crowd over to his side, Milborne declaimed
much against King James, popery and arbitrary
power; but his oratory was lost upon the
hearers, who, after several meetings, still adhered
to the convention. Milborne drew up a few of his
men in line of battle and advanced to within a
few paces of the fort with bayonets fixed. Mr.
Schuyler had the utmost difficulty to prevent both
his own men and the Mohawks, who were then in
Albany, and perfectly devoted to his service, from
firing upon Milborne's party, which consisted of
an inconsiderable number. Under these circumstances,
he thought proper to retreat, and soon after
departed from Albany. A second expedition in the
Spring proved more successful, for he gained possession
of the city and fort. No sooner was he in
possession of the garrison, than most of the principal
members absconded, upon which, their effects
were arbitrarily seized and confiscated, which so
highly exasperated the sufferers, that their posterity,
for a long time, hurled their bitterest invectives
against Leisler and his adherents.</p>

<p>It was during these intestine troubles and the
threatened Indian wars, that Governor Leisler's
daughter was in Salem out of the way of danger.
The New Englanders were keeping up a petty warfare
with the Owenagungas, Ourages and Penocooks.
Between these and the Schakook Indians,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
there was a friendly communication, and the same
was suspected of the Mohawks, among whom some
of the Owenagungas had taken sanctuary. This
led to conferences between commissioners from
Boston, Plymouth, Connecticut and other places,
for it was essential to the peace of the English colonists
to preserve peace and general amnesty with
the powerful Five Nations, and hold them as allies
against the hostile French in Canada and the Indians
of the east.</p>

<p>Colonel Henry Sloughter had been commissioned
governor of New York, January 4, 1689; but he
did not arrive to take possession until 1691, over
two years after his commission, when the vessel
bearing the new governor, <i>The Beaver</i>, arrived in
the harbor.</p>

<p>Fair historians have acquitted Mr. Leisler of any
blame in what others have been pleased to call his
usurpation. He was a man not wholly without
ambition, yet he was honest and did what he
thought right. He had much of the stubbornness
as well as honesty of the Netherlands in his composition,
and believing himself in the right, determined
to persist in it. Jacob Milborne, his English
son-in-law, was the more ambitious of the two,
and had guided and directed the affair. Leisler
was sitting in his house when informed by Milborne
that a vessel called <i>The Beaver</i> had arrived,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
bearing Colonel Sloughter, who purported to have
a governor's commission.</p>

<p>"Then we will greet him as our governor," said
the honest Leisler.</p>

<p>"Wait until you know he is not an impostor,
and that this is not a trick to seize our fort," cautioned
Milborne. Then Leisler, reconsidering the
matter, decided to wait.</p>

<p><i>The Beaver</i> brought with it one Ingoldsby, who
had a commission as captain. When Ingoldsby
appeared, Leisler offered him quarters in the city:</p>

<p>"Possession of his majesty's fort is what I demand,"
Ingoldsby replied, and he issued a proclamation
requiring submission. The aristocratic
party, which had long been chafing under the rule
of the republican uprising under Leisler, thus obtained
as a leader one who held a commission from
the new sovereign. Leisler, conforming to the
original agreement made with his fellow-insurgents,
replied that Ingoldsby had produced no order from
the king, or from Sloughter, who, it was known
had received a commission as governor, and, promising
him aid as a military officer, refused to surrender
the fort. The troops as they landed were
received with all courtesy and accommodation; yet
passions ran high, and a shot was fired at them.
The outrage was severely reproved by Leisler, who,
on March 10th, the day of the landing of the troops<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
issued proclamations and counter proclamations,
promising obedience to Sloughter on his arrival.</p>

<p>It was on the evening of March 19th, that this
profligate, needy, and narrow-minded adventurer,
who held the royal commission, arrived in New
York, and Leisler at once sent messengers to receive
his orders. Leisler's messengers were detained,
and next morning he sent the new governor
a letter asking him to whom he should surrender
the fort. His letter was unheeded, and Sloughter,
who had already come to hate the republican
Leisler, ordered Ingoldsby to arrest him and all
the persons called his council.</p>

<p>The prisoners, eight in number, were promptly
arraigned before a special court, constituted for the
purpose by an ordinance, with inveterate royalists
as judges. Six of the inferior insurgents, who
made their defence, were convicted of high treason
and reprieved. Leisler and Milborne denied to the
governor the power to institute a tribunal for judging
his predecessor, and appealed to the king. In
vain they plead the merit of their zeal for King
William, since they had so lately opposed his governor.
Leisler in particular attempted to justify
his conduct from the standpoint that Lord Nottingham's
letter entitled him to act in the capacity of
lieutenant-governor; but through ignorance, or
sycophancy, the judges, instead of delivering their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
own opinion on this branch of the prisoner's defence,
referred it to the governor and council,
praying their opinion, whether that letter, "or any
other letters, or papers, in the packet from Whitehall,
can be understood, or interpreted, to be and
contain any power or direction to Captain Leisler,
to take the government of this province upon himself,
or that the administration thereupon be holden
good in law."</p>

<p>Of course the decision was against Leisler, and
they were arraigned at the bar of justice for the
crime of high treason. On their refusal to plead,
they were condemned of high treason as mutes,
and sentenced to death. Joseph Dudley of New
England, but at this time chief justice of New
York, gave it as his opinion that Leisler had no
legal authority whatever, while Sloughter wrote:</p>

<p>"Certainly, never greater villains lived; but I
have resolved to wait for the royal pleasure, if, by
any other means than hanging, I can keep the
country quiet."</p>

<p>Jacob Leisler was tried and condemned early in
May, 1691, while Charles Stevens and Adelpha
were hastening to New York. Charles, who had
heard something of the offence of Governor Leisler,
and who, young as he was, had come to realize
that royalty yielded nothing to the republican
ideas, began to fear the worst. The acts of Leisler<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
had the semblance of popular government, and
even the liberal William and Mary had their dread
of the people. Charles knew Sloughter by reputation
as a narrow-minded, bigoted knave, who
would scruple at nothing which tended to elevate
him in the eyes of the aristocratic party, of which
he was a conspicuous devotee. Charles could offer
but little consolation, and, as he contemplated
Adelpha's sad future, he asked himself:</p>

<p>"Has the wheel of fortune changed its revolutions,
and is the sun which has ever shone bright
for Adelpha to be clouded? God forbid!"</p>

<p>Charles Stevens and Adelpha reached New York
on the very day the assembly was convened (May
14th, 1691) to determine the fate of Leisler and
Milborne.</p>

<p>It was evening, and when they entered the town
and the once beautiful home now despoiled, was
dark and sad. The weeping mother met her daughter
at the door.</p>

<p>The character of the assembly was thoroughly
royalist. It passed several resolutions against
Leisler, especially declaring his conduct at the fort
an act of rebellion, and on the 15th of May, the
second day of their session and the next after the
arrival of Adelpha, Sloughter, in a moment of excitement,
assented to the vote of the council, that
Leisler and Milborne should be executed. "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
house, according to their opinion given, did approve
of what his excellency and council had done."</p>

<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Eight men, bearing litters, were at the door. All were dripping with water.</span></p>

<p>The families of the doomed were notified that on
the next day, the 16th of May, 1691, Leisler and
Milborne would be hung. The morning of the
16th dawned gloomy and dark. The rain poured
in torrents; but Mrs. Alice Leisler and her family,
accompanied by Charles, went to bid the doomed
men adieu at the jail. Then Charles hurried the
weeping women and children home. Great thunder-bolts
seemed to rend Manhattan Island. The
lightning spread a lurid glare on the sky, and the
rain fell in torrents. All of the household knew
what was being done, and, falling on their knees,
they prayed God for strength. Two hours wore
on, and then there came a rap at the door.</p>

<p>Charles went and opened it. Eight men, bearing
litters, on which were stretched two lifeless
forms, were at the door. All were dripping with
water.</p>

<p>"Come in!" said Charles, and he sprang to seize
Adelpha, who had fallen to the floor in a convulsion.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens was detained in New York
until early in 1692. First he became involved in
trouble through his sympathy with the unfortunate
Leisler family and was thrown into prison; but a
few days later he was released on bond. Then he
lingered awaiting his trial; but the case was finally
dismissed, and then he joined an expedition against
the Indians on the frontier. He wrote home regularly
and never failed to mention Cora in his letter.
All the while, Charles was at a loss to decide
whether it was Cora or Adelpha who had won his
affections. Adelpha's great misfortune and grief
only seemed to endear her to him, for the noblest
hearts grow more tender with sorrow.</p>

<p>Early in 1692, he returned to Salem after an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
absence of ten months. Great changes were soon
to come about. Salem was about to enter upon
that career of madness known in history as Salem
Witchcraft. There are few portions of ancient or
modern history which exhibit stranger or more
tragical and affecting scenes than that known as
Salem Witchcraft, and few matters of authentic
history remain so deeply shrouded in mystery at
the present day. The delusion has never been satisfactorily
explained, and time seems to obscure
rather than throw light upon the subject.</p>

<p>At this period, the belief in witchcraft was general
throughout Christendom, as is evinced by the
existence of laws for the punishment of witches
and sorcerers in almost every kingdom, state, province
and colony. Persons suspected of being
witches, or wizards, were tried, condemned and
put to death by the authority of the most enlightened
tribunals in Europe. Only a few years before
the occurrences in New England, Sir Matthew
Hale, a judge highly and justly renowned for the
strength of his understanding, the variety of his
knowledge and the eminent Christian graces which
adorned his character, had, after a long and anxious
investigation, adjudged a number of men and
women to die for this offence.</p>

<p>Only a few rare minds, such as Charles Stevens,
living far in advance of the age, were skeptical on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the subject of witchcraft. These bold spirits placed
themselves in great danger of being "cried out
upon" as witches themselves.</p>

<p>This delusion had its fountain-head in Salem;
but it was by no means confined to this locality.
It spread all over the American colonies and, like
most superstitions, hovered along the frontier,
where it was fostered in the shadow of ignorance
and grew in the dark halls of superstition. The
author will not deny that there are many, to this
day, who attribute what they do not in the light of
reason understand, to supernatural agencies. In
Virginia, in Ohio, Kentucky, Illinois and Missouri
there existed, in their early days, strange
stories of witchcraft.</p>

<p>If the butter did not form from the milk, some
witch was in the churn. If the cattle died of an
epidemic, or a disease unknown to the poor science
of the day, it was the result of witchcraft. If a
child or grown person was afflicted with some
strange disease, such as epilepsy, the "jerks," "St.
Vitus' dance," "rickets" or other strange nervous
complaints, which they could not understand, they
at once attributed it to witchcraft.</p>

<p>There sprang up a class of people called
"witch-doctors" who, it was claimed, had power
to dispel the charm and bring the witch to grief.
The only way a witch could relieve herself and reestablish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
her power was to go to the house of the
person bewitched and borrow something. As, in
those early days, all articles of domestic use were
scarce, and neighbors depended on borrowing, many
an old lady was amazed to find herself refused,
and was wholly unable to account for the sudden
coolness of persons, whom she had always loved.</p>

<p>Mr. Parris, the fanatic, fraud and schemer, perhaps
did more to augment witchcraft, than any
other person in the colonies. Parris was ambitious.
The circle of young girls, as the reader will
remember, first held their s&eacute;ances at his home.
Their young nervous systems were so wrought upon,
that, at their age in life, they were thrown into
spasms resembling epileptic fits. Instead of treating
their disease scientifically, as such cases would
be treated at present, the parson foolishly declared
that they were bewitched. Those children could
not have been wholly impostors. They were deceived
by the preachers and the zealous, bloodthirsty
bigots into actually believing some of the
statements they uttered. Their nerves were shattered,
their imaginations wrought upon, until they
took almost any shape capricious fancy or the evil-minded
Parris would dictate.</p>

<p>When Charles Stevens arrived in Salem, instead
of finding the dread superstition a thing of the
past, to be forgotten or remembered only with a sense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
of shuddering shame, he found that the flame had
been fanned to a conflagration. Mr. Parris and Mr.
Noyes contrived to preach from their pulpits sermons
on protean devils and monsters of the air,
until the more credulous of their congregations
were almost driven to insanity. One evening, as
Parris was passing the home of Goody Vance, she
met him at the door, and, with a face blanched
with fear and annoyance, said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Parris, I am grievously annoyed with a
witch in my churn."</p>

<p>"What does she do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"She prevents the butter from forming, and I
have churned until my arms seem as if they would
drop off."</p>

<p>The parson's face grew grave, and, going to a
certain tree, he broke some switches from it and
entered the house.</p>

<p>"Take the milk from the churn," he said.
"Pour it into a skillet and place the skillet on the
coals before the fire."</p>

<p>This was done, and the astounded housewife,
with her numerous children, stood gazing at the
pastor, who, with his white, cadaverous face, thin
lips and hooked nose, looked as if he might have
power over the spirits of darkness. He drew a
chair up before the fire and, seating himself, began
whipping the milk, saying:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do this in the name of the Lord," which he
repeated with every stroke.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 605px;">
<img src="images/stroke.jpg" width="605" height="581"
alt=">At every stroke he repeated, 'I do this in the name of the Lord.'"
title=">At every stroke he repeated, 'I do this in the name of the Lord.'" />
</div>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">At every stroke he repeated, "I do this in the name of the Lord."</span></p>

<p>Goody Nurse, who was on the best of terms with
Goody Vance, had unfortunately broken the spindle
of her wheel and, knowing that her neighbor had
an extra one, came to borrow it. She was astonished
to see their pastor seated before a skillet of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
milk whipping it with switches. No sooner was
her errand made known, than Parris, leaping to
his feet, cried:</p>

<p>"No! no! lend her nothing, or you will break
the spell! Avaunt, vile witch, or I will scourge
you until your shoulders are bare and bleeding."</p>

<p>Goody Nurse, astonished and terrified, retired,
and next Lord's day the incident formed a theme
for Mr. Parris' sermon. This was the first sermon
Charles had heard since his return.</p>

<p>"Mother, I will go no more to hear Mr. Parris,"
Charles declared, on reaching home.</p>

<p>"You must, my son. The laws of the colony
compel the attendance on divine worship."</p>

<p>"Such laws should be repealed as foolish.
Compel one to go to church, to listen to such nonsense!"
and Charles hurried away in disgust.</p>

<p>Cora had been watching him during his conversation
with his mother. He had scarcely been
able to speak with her at all since his return.
Charles turned toward her as he ceased speaking,
and Cora, seeming to dread meeting his eyes, was
about to disappear into her room, when he called
her:</p>

<p>"Cora, don't go away. I must talk with you."</p>

<p>"What would you say?" she asked, her heart
fluttering in her bosom like a captive bird.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is much. Let us go down to the brook
and sit on the green banks as we used to do."</p>

<p>She trembled, hesitated a moment and acquiesced.
They went slowly down the path,
neither saying a word until the brook was reached.
When they were seated on the bank, Charles asked:</p>

<p>"Cora, are you still persecuted by Mr. Parris?
Does he continue to denounce you?"</p>

<p>"He does."</p>

<p>"That is an evidence that he is a man of low
qualities. And he still assails Goody Nurse?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Goody Nurse, Goody Corey, Bishop
and Casty have all been cried out upon, and it is
not known when they will stop."</p>

<p>"This craze has assumed dangerous proportions,
Cora."</p>

<p>"It has. They are going to law," she answered.
"Some are already in jail."</p>

<p>"I have heard of it, and, with prejudiced judges
and juries and false witnesses, life will be in great
peril."</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>Then Charles was silent for a moment, listening
to the song of a bird in its leafy bower. When
the feathered songster had warbled forth his lay
and flown to a distant tree on which to try its
notes, Charles asked:</p>

<p>"Have you seen your father recently?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>"He was here two months ago."</p>

<p>"Did he want to take you away with him?"</p>

<p>"He did; but I could not go. I promised to
remain until your return."</p>

<p>"Cora, may it not be dangerous so far on the
frontier?"</p>

<p>"There is danger; but he has secured me a home
with the family of Mr. Dustin, where he thinks I
will be safe."</p>

<p>"Is your father's brother with him?"</p>

<p>"He is."</p>

<p>"Did they come here together?"</p>

<p>"Yes; they are inseparable."</p>

<p>"Cora, don't you think there is some mystery
about those brothers, which you do not understand?"</p>

<p>"I know there is."</p>

<p>"Were they both players?"</p>

<p>"I believe they once were."</p>

<p>"Have you told your father of the persecutions
of Mr. Parris?"</p>

<p>"Not all."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It would have done no good, and would have
caused him unnecessary annoyance," she answered
meekly.</p>

<p>"Just like you, Cora, always afraid of making
some one trouble."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>Her eyes were on the brooklet and filled with
tears, as she remembered how happy Adelpha
Leisler had been when at Salem, and how heavily
the hand of affliction had fallen upon her.</p>

<p>"Charles, were you with her when it happened?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"Did you comfort her?"</p>

<p>"Such poor words of comfort as one can offer on
such occasions, I gave her," he answered.</p>

<p>"It was so sad, and she is so good, so kind and
so noble. Did she bear up well under her great
afflictions?"</p>

<p>"As well as one could."</p>

<p>"Alas, the fires of affliction are to try the faithful.
God gave her strength to bear up under her
trials and sufferings."</p>

<p>"Her troubles are over, Cora, and ours are but
just begun."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"This cloud of superstition which is settling
about us may engulf us in ruin."</p>

<p>She made no answer. Cora was very pretty as
she sat on the embankment, her eyes upon the
crystal stream, gliding onward like a gushing,
gleesome child, and he could not but declare her
the most beautiful being he had ever seen. Charles
Stevens was no coquette. He was not trifling with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
the heart or happiness of either Cora or Adelpha,
and he had never yet spoken a word of love to
either. Both had won his sympathy, his esteem
and admiration; but, until he had satisfied himself
which had in reality won his heart, he would make
no avowal to either. Seeing that what he said
was calculated to throw a shade of gloom over her,
he changed the subject by saying:</p>

<p>"Let us not anticipate evil, Cora. Wait until
it is upon us."</p>

<p>"Spoken like a philosopher," she answered;
"but, Charles, if you see evil in the future, why
not all go away?"</p>

<p>"Where should we go?"</p>

<p>"Far to the north and east. My father has
found a home in the heart of a great, dense forest.
There man is as free as the birds of the air, and
nothing can fetter thought or will. No bigoted
pastor can say, 'You shall worship God in this
fashion;' but all are permitted to worship God as
they choose. There are only the friendly skies,
the grand old forest and God to judge human actions,
instead of narrow-minded people, with false
notions of religion."</p>

<p>"I could not go, Cora."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"This is my home. I know no other. Over
in yonder church-yard, sleeps my sainted father.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
He won this pleasant home from the stern, unyielding
wilderness, and I will not be driven from it by
a set of false fanatics, who accuse, or may accuse
us of impossible crimes."</p>

<p>"Charles, if my father builds us a home in the
great wilderness, won't you and your mother come
and visit with us, until this storm cloud has blown
away? I do not ask you to give up your home.
I do not ask you to shrink from the defence of it;
but a short sojourn abroad cannot be thought to be
an abandonment. You should accept our hospitality
to afford us an opportunity to repay the debt
of gratitude we owe, as well as to secure your mother
from an annoyance, which is growing painful."</p>

<p>Her argument was very strong and had its
weight with Charles.</p>

<p>"When do you expect your father?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Any time, or no time. He knows not himself
when he may come. Poor father; he hath
labored arduously to subdue the forest and build
us a home. We had nothing,&mdash;we were slaves."</p>

<p>"But slaves no longer, Cora."</p>

<p>"Why not? Our term has not expired."</p>

<p>"King William has pardoned all the participators
in Monmouth's rebellion."</p>

<p>For a moment, she was overwhelmed with joy
and, clapping her hands, gazed toward heaven,
murmuring:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh my God, I thank thee!" but, anon, the reaction
came. The pardon for participation in
Monmouth's rebellion was granted; but the subsequent
crime&mdash;the flight from the master and the
slaying of the overseer&mdash;could not be cured by the
king's pardon to the Monmouth rebels. With a
gasping sob, she said:</p>

<p>"But that other&mdash;that awful thing?"</p>

<p>"What, Cora?"</p>

<p>"The flight, the pursuit and the death of the
overseer. Oh, Charles, we can never be safe,
while that hangs over us."</p>

<p>Charles Stevens gazed upon the pretty face
bathed in tears, beheld the agony which seemed to
overwhelm her, and his soul went out toward the
poor maid. He had little consolation to offer; but
his fertile brain was not wholly barren of resources.</p>

<p>"Cora, don't give way to despair," he said.
"What your father did was right and justifiable,
though technically the law may take a different
view. I have a relative living in Virginia, wealthy
and influential. I shall write to him to procure a
pardon for your father."</p>

<p>"I know him. The good man, Robert Stevens,
who so kindly gave us a home and aided us to escape.
He will do all he can for us."</p>

<p>"He is rich and powerful, and I believe he can
ultimately procure a pardon for Mr. Waters."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Having consoled her, they rose and returned to
the house.</p>

<p>That same evening, Charles Stevens met John
Bly near the house of his mother.</p>

<p>"How have you been, John?" Charles asked.
"This is the first time I have seen you since my
return."</p>

<p>"I am as well as one can be who has been ridden
twenty leagues," Bly answered.</p>

<p>"Ridden twenty leagues?" cried Charles Stevens
in amazement. "Pray what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I was turned into a horse last night and ridden
twenty leagues during the darkness, and I am sore
and almost exhausted now."</p>

<p>Charles laughed and passed on.</p>

<p>"I verily believe that all are going mad," he
thought. As he went away, he heard Bly say:</p>

<p>"Verily, if you doubt that this one Martin is a
witch, fall but once in her power, and you will
give ear to what I have said of her."</p>

<p>Next day he met John Kembal, a woodman.
Kembal had his axe on his shoulder, and his face
was very pale.</p>

<p>"Charles, why did you not tarry in the west?"
he asked. "Why came you back to this land
most accursed of devils."</p>

<p>"John Kembal, have you, too, gone mad over
this delusion of witchcraft?" asked Charles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>"Charles, verily, you have forgotten that the
Scriptures say that he that hath eyes let him see,
and he that hath ears let him hear. Thank God,
I have both eyes and ears, and I have seen and
heard, though I would that I had not."</p>

<p>"What have you seen, John Kembal?" Charles
asked.</p>

<p>"I will tell you without delay; but I can but
pause to thank God with every breath that she can
no longer do me injury, seeing she is in prison
and chains."</p>

<p>"Whom do you accuse?"</p>

<p>"Susanna Martin."</p>

<p>"What harm has she done you?"</p>

<p>"Listen, and I will tell you all that I know
myself. Susanna Martin, the accused, upon a
causeless disgust, did threaten me, about a certain
cow of mine, that she should never do me any
more good, and it came to pass accordingly; for,
soon after, the cow was found dead on the dry
ground, without any distemper to be discerned
upon her; upon which I was followed with a
strange death upon more of my cattle, whereof I
lost to the value of thirty pounds."</p>

<p>"Perchance, some disease broke out among
them," suggested Charles.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay; do not forge that excuse for this
creature of darkness. I have more to tell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Being desirous to furnish myself with a dog, I applied
myself to buy one of this Martin, who had a
female with whelps in her house; but she not letting
me have my choice, I said I would supply
myself at one Blezdel's, whereupon I noticed that
she was greatly displeased. Having marked a
puppy at Blezdel's, I met George Martin, the husband
of Susanna Martin, who asked me:</p>

<p>"'Will you not have one of my wife's puppies?'
and I answered:</p>

<p>"'No; I have got one at Blezdel's, which I like
better.'</p>

<p>"The same day one Edmond Eliot, being at
Martin's house, heard George Martin relate to his
wife that I had been at Blezdel's and had bought a
puppy. Whereupon Susanna Martin flew into a
great rage and answered:</p>

<p>"'If I live, I'll give him puppies enough!'</p>

<p>"Within a few days after, I was coming out of
the woods, when there arose a little black cloud in
the northwest, and I immediately felt a force upon
me, which made me not able to avoid running upon
the stumps of trees that were before me, albeit I
had a broad, plain cart-way before me; but though
I had my axe on my shoulder, to endanger me in
my falls, I could not forbear going out of my way
to tumble over the stumps, where the trees had
been cut away. When I came below the meeting-house,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
there appeared unto me a little thing like a
puppy, of a darkish color, and it shot backward
and forward between my legs. I had the courage
to use all possible endeavors of cutting it with my
axe; but I could
not hit it. The
puppy gave a jump
from me and went,
as to me it seemed,
into the ground.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

</div>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">"Its motions were quicker than those of my axe."</span></p>

<p>"On going a little
further, there appeared
unto me a
black puppy, somewhat
bigger than the
first, but as black as
a coal. Its motions
were quicker than
those of my axe; it
flew at my belly, and
away; then at my
throat; so, over my shoulder one way, and then
over my shoulder another way. My heart now
began to fail me, and I thought the dog would
have torn my throat out; but I recovered myself
and called upon God in my distress; and, naming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>the name of Jesus Christ, it vanished away at
once."</p>

<p>Charles Stevens tried to argue with Bly that he
had had an attack of blind staggers, and that the
dog was only an optical delusion; but he could in
no way convince him that it was not a reality, and
that he was not bewitched.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Bancroft, New England, like
Canaan, had been settled by fugitives. Like the
Jews, they had fled to a wilderness. Like the
Jews, they had looked to heaven for a light to lead
them on. Like the Jews, they had heathen for
their foes, and they derived their highest legislation
from the Jewish code. Cotton Mather said,
"New England being a country whose interests
are remarkably inwrapped in ecclesiastical circumstances,
ministers ought to concern themselves in
politics." Cotton Mather and Mr. Parris did concern
themselves in politics, and the latter, being
unscrupulous and ambitious as well as fanatical,
caused hundreds of unfortunate people to mourn.</p>

<p>The circle of children who had been meeting at
the house of Mr. Parris began to perform wonders.
In the dull life of the country, the excitement of
the proceedings of the "circle" was welcome, no
doubt, and it was always on the increase. The
human mind requires amusement, as the human
body requires food, exercise and rest, and when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
healthful and innocent amusements are denied, resort
is had to the low and vicious. Mr. Parris,
who preached sermons against the evils of the
theatre and excommunicated the child of an actor,
fostered in his own house an amusement as diabolical
and dangerous as has ever been known.
Results of that circle were wonderful. Whatever
trickery there might be&mdash;and, no doubt, there was
plenty; whatever excitement to hysteria; whatever
actual sharpening of common faculties, it is clear
that there was more; and those who have given
due and dispassionate attention to the process of
mesmerism and its effects can have no difficulty in
understanding the reports handed down of what
these young creatures did and said and saw, under
peculiar conditions of the nervous system. When
the physicians of the district could see no explanation
of the ailments of the afflicted children "but
the evil hand," they, with one accord, came to the
conclusion that their afflictions were through the
agencies of Satan.</p>

<p>Convulsions and epilepsy are among the many
mysteries which medical science has not mastered
to this day, and one cannot wonder that the doctors
two centuries ago should declare the afflicted ones
bewitched. Then came the inquiry as to who had
stricken the children, and the readiest means that
occurred was to ask this question of the children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
themselves. At first they refused to disclose any
names; but there was soon an end to any such
delicacy. The first prominent symptoms occurred
in November, 1691, and the first public examination
of witches took place March 1st, 1692, just
before the return of Charles Stevens from New
York.</p>

<p>One among the first arrested was Sarah Good,
a weak, ignorant, poor, despised woman, whose
equally weak and ignorant husband had abandoned
her, leaving her to the mercy of evil tongues.
This ignorant woman was taken to jail, and,
shortly after, her child, little Dorcas, only four
years old, was also arrested and imprisoned in
chains on charge of witchcraft. All this met the
approval of Mr. Parris, whose pale, thin face
glowed with triumph as he declared:</p>

<p>"Now is the coming of the Lord, and the consumption
of the fire-brands of hell."</p>

<p>No wonder Charles Stevens was serious. Over
twenty people were in prison on charge of witchcraft,
among them an Irish woman, a Roman Catholic,
hated more on account of her religion than
any suspicion of evil against her. She was among
the first to hang.</p>

<p>Parris, the wild-eyed fanatic, swinging his arms
about, walked up and down the village, crying
against the evil spirits of the air and longing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
get his clutches on the vile actor, who had dared
enter the consecrated village of Salem.</p>

<p>One evening Mr. Waters returned as mysteriously
as he had disappeared. His daughter was
greatly rejoiced to see him and, after the joy of the
first greeting was over, told of all that was transpiring
and of the threats of Mr. Parris.</p>

<p>"You must go away," he said.</p>

<p>"When?" she asked.</p>

<p>"On the morrow."</p>

<p>Charles had a short talk with Mr. Waters, and
arrangements were made for the departure of Cora
on the morrow. Mr. Waters retired late that
night to his room. As he was in the act of undressing,
he became conscious that a face was
pressed against the window. He stood in the dark
corner where he could scarce be seen. He held a
pistol in his hand until the face disappeared from
the window, and creeping to it, looked out.
There stood a man in the broad glare of the moon.
He had only to glance at his tall form and his
ruffian features to recognize him as the brother of
the overseer whom he had shot in Virginia. For
ten minutes Mr. Waters did not move, but kept
his eyes riveted on the man, who, instinct and
reason told him, was an enemy. At last the man
retired down the path under the hill. Mr. Waters
hurriedly wrote a few lines on a scrap of paper, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
only the moon for his candle, and, folding the letter,
addressed it to his daughter and laid it on his
pillow. Then he opened the window and leaped
out to the ground.</p>

<p>He followed the man under the hill, where he
found him in conversation with three other men,
Mr. Parris, John Bly and Louder. He was near
enough to hear what they said and catch their
plans; but he did not wait to listen. As he was
creeping among the bushes, a man suddenly rose
before him. His dark, tawny skin, his blanket
and features indicated that he was an aborigine.
He had seen the white men under the hill, and he
told Mr. Waters that he had ten braves at hand.</p>

<p>"Tell them to do no one harm, Oracus," said
Mr. Waters. "I have never harmed mankind,
save in defence, and, God willing, I never will.
I am going away."</p>

<p>The Indian silently bowed and disappeared into
the forest. Mr. Waters paused under a large oak
tree and gazed at the house where his daughter
was sleeping so peacefully; then he went away to
the great north woods.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens was sleeping soundly, dreaming
of Cora and peace, when there came a rap at
the outer door. He rose and, but half-dressed,
proceeded to open it. Four tall, dark men stood
without. By the aid of the moon, he recognized
Mr. Parris, Bly and Louder.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Waters here?" asked Mr. Parris.</p>

<p>"He is asleep in his room," Charles answered.</p>

<p>"Awake him. This good man from Virginia
wants to see him."</p>

<p>Charles turned away and went to Mr. Waters'
room. The door was ajar, and, entering, he found
the apartment vacant. An open window showed
by what means Mr. Waters had made his escape.
Charles hastened to inform the nocturnal visitors,
and a scene ensued that can be as well imagined as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
described. Charles was upbraided for aiding a
criminal to escape. Mr. Joel Martin, the brother
of the overseer shot in Virginia, was enraged that
his brother's slayer should, after years of search,
be discovered only to escape his clutches, while Mr.
Parris, with assumed piety declared:</p>

<p>"It is ever thus, when one covenants with the
devil. An actor in the theatres taken to the home
and family of those claiming to be Christians.
Verily, I am not surprised that he is also a
murderer. When one lets go his hold on the
Lord, there can be no crime to which he will not
descend."</p>

<p>The household was roused, and Cora was informed
of her father's narrow escape. Mr. Martin
from Virginia had a requisition from that colony
for his arrest. She wept, but said not a word.
When the disappointed officers went away, Charles
sought to comfort her; but she answered:</p>

<p>"Cruel fate seems to have doomed me to misery,
Charles. Father cannot return; I cannot escape,
and I feel that Mr. Parris is drawing a net about
me, which will entangle my feet."</p>

<p>"Trust in God, and all is well!" Charles answered.
Often, in their darkest hours, her pious
father had offered the same advice, for he was a
firm believer in divine intervention in human
affairs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day a daughter of Goody Nurse came to
the house, weeping as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Sarah?" asked Mrs.
Stevens.</p>

<p>"Mother is arrested!" sobbed the young woman.</p>

<p>"Arrested!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"For what charge?" Charles asked.</p>

<p>"For being a witch. A warrant has been sworn
out against her, and she was taken away this morning."
Here the unfortunate young woman broke
down and sobbed in silence.</p>

<p>"Where was she taken?" asked Mrs. Stevens.</p>

<p>"To jail and put in irons, for a witch must be
put in irons. It is charged that she hath bewitched
Abigail Williams and the other children of Mr.
Parris' circle."</p>

<p>Were Mr. Parris a creation of fiction and not a
real character of history, no doubt the critic would
say he was overdrawn; but Samuel Parris was a
living, breathing man, or a fiend in human form.
He had a large following, and was spoken of as
our beloved pastor. Mr. George Bancroft,
America's greatest historian, says:<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> Bancroft's "History of the United States", vol. ii., p.
256.</p></div>

<p>"The delusion, but for Parris, would have languished.
Of his own niece, the girl of eleven
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>years of age, he demanded the names of the devil's
instruments, who bewitched the band of 'the afflicted,'
and then became at once informer and
witness. In those days, there was no prosecuting
officer, and Parris was at hand to question his Indian
servants and others, himself prompting their
answers and acting as recorder to the magistrates.
The recollection of the old controversy in the
parish could not be forgotten; and Parris, moved
by personal malice as well as blind zeal, 'stifled
the accusation of some,' such is the testimony of
the people of his own village, and, at the same
time, 'vigilantly promoting the accusation of
others,' was 'the beginning and procurer of the
afflictions of Salem village and country.' Martha
Corey, who, on her examination in the meeting-house,
before a throng, with a firm spirit, alone,
against them all, denied the presence of witchcraft,
was committed to prison. Rebecca Nurse, likewise
a woman of purest life, an object of special
hatred of Parris, resisted the company of accusers,
and was committed. And Parris, filling his
prayers with the theme, made the pulpit ring with
it. 'Have not I chosen you twelve,'&mdash;such was
his text,&mdash;'and one of you is a devil?' At this,
Sarah Cloyce, sister to Rebecca Nurse, rose up and
left the meeting-house, and she, too, was cried out
upon and sent to prison."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Stevens, her son and Cora Waters tried to
soothe the fears of the poor young maid, who, in
her hour of affliction, childlike, had flown to her
friends with her tale of woe.</p>

<p>"I will go at once and denounce Mr. Parris for
the part he has played in this!" cried Charles,
starting from the house. At the little gate, he was
overtaken by Cora, who, laying her hand on his
arm, said:</p>

<p>"Don't go, Charles. Don't leave the house
while in this heat of passion."</p>

<p>"Cora, I cannot endure that hypocrite longer.
He is a devil, not a man, to carry his malice so
far."</p>

<p>"But reflect, Charles. What you might say in
the heat of your anger can do poor Goody Nurse
no good."</p>

<p>"It will be a relief to me."</p>

<p>"No; it may engender future trouble. This is
a trying hour; the danger is great; let us take
time for deliberation."</p>

<p>He was persuaded by Cora to say nothing at
that time and returned to the house. To the sorrowing
daughter had been administered such consolation
as faithful, loving friends could offer, and
she went home hoping that her unfortunate mother
might yet escape the wrath of Mr. Parris.</p>

<p>"It is all the work of Samuel Parris," declared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Mrs. Stevens. "Because Goody Nurse opposed
his ministry, he seeks revenge."</p>

<p>"Parris is an unworthy man," Charles declared.</p>

<p>Before he could say more, Cora Waters, who
had posted herself as a sentry at the door said:</p>

<p>"Here comes Ann Putnam."</p>

<p>At mention of this woman's name, both Charles
and his mother became silent. She was the mother
of one of the afflicted children, and was herself of
high nervous temperament, undisciplined in mind,
and an absolute devotee to her pastor. She was
at this time about thirty years of age, with blue
eyes, brown hair and face fair and round. As she
entered the door, almost out of breath, she cried:</p>

<p>"I come, Goody Stevens, to be the bearer of
what I trust will be welcome tidings. Goody
Nurse hath been arrested and sent to prison for
her grievously tormenting the family of Mr. Parris
and myself."</p>

<p>"Can you suspect that such news will be welcome
tidings in this home?" cried Mrs. Stevens.
"Ann Putnam, truly you must believe that I am
unworthy to be called woman, if you think I can
rejoice at the downfall of that good woman."</p>

<p>"Good woman!" shrieked Ann Putnam, stamping
her foot on the floor with such force as to make
the house quiver. "Good woman! She is a
witch! She opposed our beloved pastor his stipend;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
she wished to remove him, and because she failed,
she now assails his household with her witchcraft.
Oh, vile creature, I would I had never seen her!"</p>

<p>"Ann Putnam, you are deluded."</p>

<p>"Deluded!" shrieked Ann Putnam, her eyes
flashing with fire. "Could you all but see me in
my sore afflictions, could you but know the fits I
have, and witness the suffering of her victims, you
would not call it delusion."</p>

<p>"Ann Putnam, Mr. Parris has so wrought upon
your imagination, that you are insane."</p>

<p>At the attempt to impute anything evil to her
beloved pastor, Ann Putnam's rage knew no
bounds, and, in a voice choking with wrath, she
declared that Mr. Parris was the most saintly man
living.</p>

<p>"His zeal for the cause of Christ hath brought
down upon him the wrath of the worldly minded.
He is a saint&mdash;a glorious saint, and because he denounced
Cora Waters for being the child of a
player, you would malign him."</p>

<p>"Ann Putnam," interrupted Charles Stevens,
"you have no right to impugn the motives of my
mother, nor to assail our guest. The zeal of Mr.
Parris has made a monster of him. He is a
wicked, cruel, revengeful man, rather than a follower
of the meek and lowly Lamb of God."</p>

<p>"I will not stay where my blessed pastor is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
spoken so ill of!" declared Ann Putnam, and she
bounded out of the door, shaking the dust off her
shoes. At the gate, she paused and held her fist
in the air, and at the height of her masculine voice
screamed:</p>

<p>"I denounce you! I cry out against you,
Hattie Stevens! I will to do no more with you!"
and having performed that wonderful act of discarding
a former friend, she turned about and hurried
over the hill.</p>

<p>"Charles, I am sorry you and your mother angered
her," said Cora.</p>

<p>"Why, Cora?" he asked.</p>

<p>"She can do us ill."</p>

<p>"Ann Putnam is an evil woman and a fit follower
of such a man as Parris," declared Charles.
"My mother did a noble act in denouncing him."</p>

<p>"It is time, Charles," interrupted Cora. "I feel,
I know that if evil befalls you, I am the cause.
I must go away. I cannot remain here to prove
the ruin of those who befriended me. I must go
away."</p>

<p>"Where would you go?"</p>

<p>"I know not where; but I will go anywhere, so
that I may not prove the ruin of my friends. The
wild heathen in the forest could not be more cruel
than these people."</p>

<p>"Cora, you shall not go!" cried Charles. "No,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
you shall not. I will protect you and mother.
I have friends, friends true and strong, friends of
whom they little dream. They live in the forest
and will come to my aid by the hundreds to fight
my battles."</p>

<p>"Do you mean the Indians?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Two years ago I saved the life of Oracus,
a young chief, and made him my friend. An
Indian, once a friend, is the truest of friends.
Oracus and his warriors would die for me."</p>

<p>"Do not appeal to the Indians, if you can avoid
it," the girl plead. Charles assured her if she did
go away, it would not remove the wrath of the
minister from them, and she decided to remain.</p>

<p>Mr. Parris hated Rebecca Nurse more than any
other person in Salem. He was now about to accomplish
his designs.</p>

<p>Until the day of trial, Rebecca Nurse lay in
jail, with great, heavy fetters, which she could
scarcely carry, upon her. Her husband, family
and friends did all in their power to procure her
release on bond; but witchcraft was not a bailable
offence.</p>

<p>They tried to secure mercy for the old woman
from Mr. Parris; but he was inexorable. When
Mr. Parris, a few months before, was publicly
complaining of neglect in the matter of firewood
for the parsonage, and of lukewarmness on the part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
of the hearers of his services, "Landlord Nurse"
was a member of the committee who had to deal
with him, and he and his relatives were among
the majority, who were longing for Mr. Parris' apparently
inevitable departure. So when, through
the machinations of the pastor, the good woman
was arrested, they appealed to him in vain for
mercy.</p>

<p>The meeting-house, in which the trial was held,
was crowded with spectators. Neighbor jostled
neighbor, and terrible, awe-inspiring whispers ran
over the throng. Prayer was offered, and the
court opened, and Rebecca Nurse, weak and sick,
old and infirm as she was, was made to stand up
before that tribunal to plead to the charge of witchcraft.
When her son would have supported his
aged mother, he was driven away.</p>

<p>Mr. Parris was the first witness called. The law
of evidence, or at least the practice in Salem at that
time, was quite different from the present. Hearsay
testimony was freely admitted in the case of
Goody Nurse. Mr. Parris stated that he was
called to see a certain person who was sick. Mercy
Lewis was sent for. She was struck dumb on entering
the chamber. She was asked to hold up her
hand, if she saw any of the witches afflicting the
patient. Presently she held up her hand, then
fell into a trance. While coming to herself, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
said that she saw the spectres of Goody Nurse and
Goody Carrier having hold of the head of the sick
man. The testimony of Mr. Parris was given in a
calm and deliberate manner calculated to impress
the jury with truth. Never did an assassin whet
his dagger with more coolness or with more malice
drive it to the heart of his victim, than did this
sanctimonious villain weave the net of ruin about
his victims.</p>

<p>Thomas Putnam, the husband of Ann Putnam,
stated that both his wife and child were bewitched
and had most grievous fits, all of which they
charged to Goody Nurse. He described his wife
as being sorely attacked and striving violently with
her arms and legs, and presently she would begin
to converse with Good-wife Nurse, saying:</p>

<p>"Goody Nurse, begone! begone! begone! Are
you not ashamed, a woman of your profession, to
afflict a poor creature so? What hurt did I ever
do you in my life? You have but two years to
live, and then the devil will torment your soul, for
this your name is blotted out of God's book, and
it shall never be put in God's book again. Begone!
For shame! Are you not afraid of what
is coming upon you? I know what will make you
afraid, the wrath of an angry God. I am sure that
will make you afraid. Begone! Do not torment
me. I know what you would have; but it is out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
of your reach; it is clothed with the white robes of
Christ's righteousness."</p>

<p>After this, she seemed to dispute with the apparition
about a particular text of Scripture, while
she kept her eyes closed all the time. The apparition
seemed to deny it, and she said she was
sure there was such a text, and she would tell it,
and then the shape would be gone. Said she:</p>

<p>"I am sure you cannot stand before that text."</p>

<p>Then she was sorely afflicted, her mouth drawn
on one side, and her body strained for about a
minute, and then she said:</p>

<p>"I will tell. I will tell, it is,&mdash;it is,&mdash;it is the
third chapter of the Revelations."</p>

<p>Such stuff could not in this day be admitted in
any intelligent court of justice.</p>

<p>Ann Putnam, the wife of Thomas Putnam, was
next to testify against Goody Nurse. She said:</p>

<p>"On March 18th, 1692, being wearied out in
helping to tend my poor afflicted child and maid,
about the middle of the afternoon I lay me down
on the bed to take a little rest; and immediately I
was almost pressed and choked to death, that, had
it not been for the mercy of a gracious God and
the help of those that were with me, I could not
have lived many moments; and presently I saw
the apparition of Martha Corey, who did torture
me so, as I cannot express, ready to tear me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
pieces, and then departed from me a little while;
but before I could recover strength, or well take
breath, the apparition of Rebecca Nurse fell upon
me again with dreadful tortures and hellish temptations
to go along with her, and she brought to me
a little red book in her hand, and a black pen,
urging me vehemently to write in her book; and
several times that day she did most grievously
torture me, almost ready to kill me. And on that
same day Martha Corey and Rebecca Nurse, the
wife of Francis Nurse senior, did both torture me,
with tortures such as no tongue can express."</p>

<p>"Did you suffer from Rebecca Nurse again?"
the witness was asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"On divers times. On the 20th, which was the
Sabbath day. After that, she came and sat upon
my breast and did sorely torment me and threaten
to bear the soul out of my body, blasphemously
denying the blessed God, and the power of the
Lord Jesus Christ to save my soul, and denying
several passages of Scripture, which I told her of,
to repel her hellish temptations."</p>

<p>The afflicted children were present, and when
the unfortunate prisoner, tired and sick, bent her
head, they began to scream and bent their heads
also. When she gazed at Abigail Williams, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
girl was seized with a convulsion, and so were the
others, so that the trial had to be suspended for a
few minutes, until quiet was restored.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens, who was present, remarked,
loud enough to be heard:</p>

<p>"If they had a stick well laid about their backs,
I trow it would cure them of such devil's capers."</p>

<p>"Have a care, Charles. Take heed of your
hasty speech," said a by-stander.</p>

<p>Mrs. Putnam, fearful that her first deposition
would not convict the woman, who had dared speak
boldly against her beloved pastor, again took the
stand and testified:</p>

<p>"Once, when Rebecca Nurse's apparition appeared
unto me, she declared that she had killed
Benjamin Houlton, John Friller, and Rebecca Shepherd,
and that she and her sister Cloyse, and Edward
Bishop's wife, had killed John Putnam's
child. Immediately there did appear to me six
children in winding-sheets, which called me aunt,
which did most grievously affright me; and they
told me they were my sister Baker's children of
Boston, and that Goody Nurse, Mistress Corey of
Charlestown and an old deaf woman at Boston
murdered them, and charged me to go and tell
these things to the magistrates, or else they would
tear me to pieces, for their blood did cry for vengeance.
Also there appeared to me my own sister<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Bayley and three of her children in winding-sheets,
and told me that Goody Nurse had murdered
them."</p>

<p>This evidence was followed by the afflicted children
bearing testimony to being grievously tormented
by defendant, who came sometimes in the
shape of a black cat, a dog, or a pig, and who was
sometimes accompanied by a black man. Louder
next related his experience of being changed to a
horse and ridden to a witches' ball, and of seeing
Rebecca Nurse ride through the air on a broomstick.
The West Indian negro man John, the
husband of Tituba and servant of Mr. Parris, was
next put on the witness stand. The magistrate
asked him:</p>

<p>"John, who hurt you?"</p>

<p>"Goody Nurse first, and den Goody Corey."</p>

<p>"What did she do to you?"</p>

<p>"She brought de book to me."</p>

<p>"John, tell the truth. Who hurt you? Have
you been hurt?"</p>

<p>"The first was a gentleman I saw."</p>

<p>"But who hurt you next?"</p>

<p>"Goody Nurse. She choke me and brought
me de book."</p>

<p>"Where did she take hold of you?"</p>

<p>"Upon my throat, to stop my breath."</p>

<p>"What did this Goody Nurse do?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>"She pinch me until de blood came."</p>

<p>At this, Ann Putnam had a fit and was carried
out. Abigail Williams was called to the stand and
asked:</p>

<p>"Abigail Williams, did you see a company at
Mr. Parris' house eat and drink?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir; that was their sacrament."</p>

<p>"How many were there?"</p>

<p>"About forty. Goody Cloyse and Goody Good
were their deacons."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"They said it was our blood, and they had it
twice that day."</p>

<p>"Have you seen a white man?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir, a great many times."</p>

<p>"What sort of a man was he?"</p>

<p>"A fine, grave man, and when he came, he made
all the witches to tremble."</p>

<p>"Did you see the party of witches at Deacon
Ingersol's?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Who was there?"</p>

<p>"Goody Cloyse, Goody Corey, Goody Nurse
and Goody Good."</p>

<p>Then the examining magistrate turned to the
old, infirm and unfortunate prisoner, and asked:</p>

<p>"What do you say, Goody Nurse, to these
things?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>The old, sick woman, summoning up all her
energies, answered:</p>

<p>"I take God to be my witness, that I know
nothing of it, no more than the child unborn."</p>

<p>The jury did not consider the evidence strong
enough for hanging an old lady, who had been the
ornament of their church and the glory of their
village and its society, and they brought in a
verdict of "not guilty."</p>

<p>The momentary rejoicing of the triumphant defendants
was drowned by the howls of the afflicted
and the upbraiding of Mr. Parris. One judge declared
himself dissatisfied; another promised to
have her tried anew; and the chief justice pointed
out a phrase used by the prisoner, which might be
made to signify that she was one of the accused
gang in guilt, as well as in jeopardy. It might
really seem as if the authorities were all scheming
together, when we see the ingenuity and persistence
with which they discussed the three words
"of our company," as used by the accused.</p>

<p>The poor old woman offered an explanation,
which ought to have been satisfactory.</p>

<p>"I intended no otherwise than as they were
prisoners with us, and therefore did then, and yet
do judge them not legal evidence against their
fellow-prisoners. And I, being something hard of
hearing and full of grief, none informing me how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
the court took up my words, therefore had no opportunity
to declare what I intended when I said
they were of our company."</p>

<p>The foreman of the jury would have taken a
favorable view of this matter, and have allowed
full consideration, while other jurymen were eager
to recall the mistake of the verdict; but the prisoner's
silence from failing to hear, when she was
expected to explain, turned the foreman against
her, and caused him to declare:</p>

<p>"Whereupon these words were to me a principal
evidence against her."</p>

<p>Still it was too monstrous to hang the poor old
woman. After her condemnation, the governor
reprieved her, probably on the ground of the illegality
of setting aside the first verdict of the jury,
in the absence of any new evidence; but Mr.
Parris, the power behind the people, caused such
an outcry against executive clemency to be raised,
that the governor withdrew his reprieve.</p>

<p>Next Sunday after the sentence, there was a
scene in the church, the record of which was afterward
annotated by the church members in grief
and humiliation. After the sacrament, by a vote,
it was unanimously agreed, that sister Nurse, being
convicted as a witch by the court, should be excommunicated
in the afternoon of the same day.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens, impelled by a morbid curiosity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
went to the church that afternoon. The place was
thronged. Parris, with the triumphant gleam of a
devil on his hypocritical features, was in the pulpit
with the elders. The deacons presided below.
The sheriff and his officers brought in the witch
and led her up the broad aisle, her chains clanking
as she stepped, and her poor old limbs scarcely able
to bear their weight. As she stood in the middle of
the aisle, the Reverend Mr. Noyes pronounced her
sentence of expulsion from the church on earth
and from all hope of salvation hereafter. Having
freely given her soul to Satan by a seven years'
service for diabolical powers, she was delivered
over to him forever. In conclusion, Reverend Mr.
Noyes said:</p>

<p>"And now, vile woman, having sold yourself to
the Devil, go to your master amid the hottest
flames of hell!"</p>

<p>She was aware that every eye regarded her with
horror and hate, unapproached under any circumstances;
but she was able to sustain it. She was
still calm and at peace that day, and during the
fortnight of final waiting. When the fatal day of
execution came, she traversed the streets of Salem,
between the houses in which she had been an honored
guest, and surrounded by well-known faces,
and then there was the hard, hard task, for her
aged limbs, of climbing the rocky and steep path<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
on Witches' Hill to the place where the gibbets
stood in a row, and the hangman was waiting for
her. Sarah Good and six others of whom Salem
chose to be rid that day went with her.</p>

</div>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">The sheriff brought the witch up the broad aisle, her chains clanking as she stepped.</span></p>

<p>It was the 19th of July, 1692, when, at a signal,
all eight swung off into eternity, and Reverend Mr.
Noyes, in his zeal, pointing to the swaying bodies,
said:</p>

<p>"There hang eight fire-brands of hell!"</p>

<p>Mr. Parris, unable to conceal his triumph, declared
these the most holy words ever uttered by
lips not divine.</p>

<p>The bodies were put away on the hill like so
many dead dogs; but during the silent watches of
the night, Charles Stevens and the sons and grandsons
of Rebecca Nurse disinterred her and brought
her remains home where a coffin had been prepared.
Mrs. Stevens and Cora Waters dressed the body in
most becoming robes. All kissed the cold dead
face of one they loved, as she lay in a rear room,
the windows blinded and a guard outside. Then
the body was hurriedly buried in a grave prepared
in the field, where soon after the afflicted husband
slept at her side.</p>

<p>Considering such horrible events, one can but
conclude that superstition was having full sway.</p>

<p>Shortly after the arrest and incarceration of
Goodwife Nurse, Reverend Deodat Lawson, an
eminent Boston divine, came to Salem village.
All land travel at that time was on horseback.
He lodged at the house of Nathaniel Ingersol
near the home of the minister Mr. Parris. The
appearance of a foreigner in the village was at
once the signal for making a new convert, and the
afflicted put themselves on exhibition to convince
him that evil spirits were abroad. He had been
but a short time at the house of Ingersol, when
Captain Walcut's daughter Mary came to see him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
and speak with him. She greeted him with a
smile, and hoped he had had a pleasant journey.</p>

<p>It was now growing late, and she stood in the
door bidding all good-evening, preparatory to going
home. Suddenly the girl gave utterance to a wild
shriek and leaped into the house, holding her wrist
in her left hand.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked Mr. Lawson.</p>

<p>"I am bitten on the wrist," she cried.</p>

<p>"Surely you cannot be bitten, for I have seen
nothing to bite you."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I am bitten. It is a witch that
hath bitten me."</p>

<p>The candle had been burning all the while in
the apartment, and Mr. Lawson knew that no one
could have been in the room without his knowledge.</p>

<p>"Some one hath grievously bitten me!" the girl
sobbed.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawson seized the candle and, holding it to
her wrist, saw apparently the marks of teeth, both
upper and lower set, on each side of her wrist.
He was lost in wonder and, placing the candle on
the mantel, remarked:</p>

<p>"It is a mystery."</p>

<p>"Yea, verily it is," Lieutenant Ingersol answered;
"but you have not seen the beginning of
the wonders of witchcraft in this village. Satan
surely hath been loosed for a little season."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have heard much of the sore afflictions of the
children at the home of Mr. Parris," remarked
Mr. Lawson.</p>

<p>"And they are sorely afflicted, as I can bear
testimony. After tea we will walk over to his
house."</p>

<p>Mr. Lawson assented, and Mary Walcut was
sent home. After an early tea, Mr. Lawson went
to the parsonage, which was but a short distance.
Mr. Parris met them at the door. His white,
cadaverous face, prominent cheek bones, aquiline
nose, piercing eyes, and wild, disheveled hair giving
him a strange, weird appearance. He greeted
Reverend Mr. Lawson warmly and thanked him
for coming all the way from Boston to preach for
him next Lord's Day.</p>

<p>"I am so sorely tried with my many afflictions,
that I cannot compose my mind for sermonizing."</p>

<p>"I have heard somewhat of the afflictions and
troubles that beset you," Rev. Deodat Lawson answered.</p>

<p>"Verily you cannot have heard more than has
occurred. I am maligned, misunderstood and
beset everywhere by the enemies of God."</p>

<p>"Meet it with prayer and humiliation," answered
Mr. Lawson.</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;I do&mdash;and, verily, the Lord is making
my enemies my footstool. Many are already in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
prison, and many more will yet go to the gallows."
The pastor gnashed his teeth in silent rage, while
his eyes gleamed with hate.</p>

<p>"How are the afflicted children?" asked Mr.
Lawson.</p>

<p>"No better. Abigail come hither."</p>

<p>Abigail Williams, the niece of the pastor, came
from an adjoining room. She was a girl of twelve,
with a fair face, but cunning eyes, which deprived
her of the innocence of childhood. Mr. Lawson
at once entered into conversation with her, but had
not proceeded far, when she uttered a shriek and,
turning her face to the ceiling, whirled about in a
circle, while her eyes, rolling back in her head,
snapped like flashes of light. Her mouth was
drawn to the left side of her face and her whole
frame convulsively jerked till she fell to the floor,
where she writhed and struggled, and blood-stained
froth issued from her mouth, while Mr. Lawson
gazed upon her appalled. Then she sprang to her
feet and hurried violently to and fro through the
room in spite of the efforts to hold her. Sometimes
she made motions as if she would fly, reaching
her arms up as high as she could, and bringing
them down at her side, crying:</p>

<p>"Whish! whish! whish!"</p>

<p>Presently she began talking in a strange, hysterical
and half inaudible manner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is Goodwife Nurse!" she cried. "Do
you not see her? Why, there she stands!" and
the girl pointed to a corner of the room that was
vacant. Her eyes seemed riveted on some object
that kept moving about. After a short silence,
Abigail Williams said:</p>

<p>"There, she is offering me the book to sign;
but I won't take it, Goody Nurse! I won't! I
won't! I won't take it! I do not know what book
it is. I am sure it is not God's book. It is the
Devil's book, for aught I know."</p>

<p>Then she remained a moment with her eyes
closed and arms folded across her breast, after
which she ran to the fire, and began to throw fire-brands
about the house, and run into the fireplace,
against the back of the wall, as if she would go up
the chimney. They caught hold of her and pulled
her out.</p>

<p>"It is nothing uncommon," Mr. Parris explained.
"In other fits, the children have sought to throw
themselves into the fire."</p>

<p>Mr. Lawson did not tarry long at the house of
the pastor; but returned to the home of Lieut.
Ingersol.</p>

<p>When Sunday came, Mr. Lawson went to the
church to preach. Several of the afflicted people
were "at meeting," for it was thought proper that
the afflicted should be in the house of God. So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
long as one was able to go to church, they were
taken, regardless of any mental affection they
might have. Mrs. Pope, Goodwife Bibber, Abigail
Williams, Mary Walcut, Mary Lewes and Doctor
Grigg's maid, all of whom were persons bewitched,
are reported by reliable historians as being present
at this "Lord's Day service." There was also
present Goodwife Corey, who was subsequently
arrested for a witch.</p>

<p>While at prayer, Mr. Lawson was interrupted
by shrieks and struggles on the part of the afflicted,
and a voice near said:</p>

<p>"Fits!"</p>

<p>He kept on praying for the Lord to relieve them
of their torments, while Charles Stevens, who was
in the house, declared that a whip would relieve
them. After the prayer, a psalm was sung, as
usual, and then Abigail Williams, turning to the
preacher, said in a loud, coarse voice:</p>

<p>"Now stand up and name your text!"</p>

<p>After he had named his text, she said:</p>

<p>"It is a long text."</p>

<p>He had scarcely begun his sermon, when Mrs.
Pope, one of the afflicted women, bawled out:</p>

<p>"Now, there is enough of that."</p>

<p>"These mad people ought to be kept away from
the house of worship," declared Charles Stevens
to a neighbor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>Rev. Mr. Lawson, unaccustomed to these interruptions,
was greatly annoyed and had to pause
frequently in his sermon. Goodwife Corey was
present at the time, and Abigail Williams, in the
midst of the sermon, cried out:</p>

<p>"Look! look, where Goodwife Corey sits on the
beam, suckling her yellow bird betwixt her fingers!"</p>

<p>At this, Ann Putnam, the daughter of Thomas
Putnam, said:</p>

<p>"There is a yellow bird sitting on Mr. Lawson's
hat, where it hangs on the pin in the pulpit."</p>

<p>Those who sat nearest the girls tried to restrain
them from speaking aloud; but it was in vain;
for, despite all precaution, they would occasionally
blurt out some ridiculous nonsense, which the
people attributed to the results of witchcraft.</p>

<p>"Charles Stevens, what say you, now that your
eyes have witnessed these abominations?" said
John Bly.</p>

<p>"I say, if I had my way, I would cure them,"
answered the youth.</p>

<p>"How would you, pray?" Bly asked.</p>

<p>"With a good whip about their shoulders."</p>

<p>"Beware, Charles Stevens, how you speak so
lightly of these afflictions, lest you bring on yourself
the same condemnation of those on Witches'
Hill."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>There are some spirits so bold, that they overawe
and intimidate even an enraged populace.
Martin Luther's very audacity saved him, on more
than one occasion, and something like the same
spirit enabled Charles Stevens to overcome or overawe
the deluded populace of Salem.</p>

<p>A few days after the execution of Goody Nurse,
he was passing the meeting house, when he was
accosted by the West Indian negro, John.</p>

<p>"You not believe in witches?" said John.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Goody Nurse brought me de book."</p>

<p>"John, I believe you lied. I believe you have
perjured yourself and sent your soul to endless
torment," answered Charles Stevens. John was a
cunning rascal and thought to give him a proof
positive of the powers of witchcraft. He fell
down in a fit, and Charles applied his cane to him
until he ran howling away effectually cured, while
Charles, disgusted with the black-skinned African,
left him and hurried out of the village.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens' favorite walk was across the
brook and among the great old oak trees beyond.
His mind was greatly harassed and, like all great
minds when perplexed, sought solitude. He went
farther and farther into the woods and sat down
upon a large stone. The recent trial of Goody
Nurse, her conviction and execution moved his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
soul. He could not understand how people, civilized
and enlightened, could be so deceived by
what, to him, was so apparent.</p>

<p>Charles knew that all were not dishonest in their
belief. He even believed that some of the actors
in this tragedy were sincere, but had been over-persuaded
by Mr. Parris, whom he set down as the
prime mover in it all.</p>

<p>He sat for a long time, much longer than he
supposed, reflecting on the past, and planning for
the future, when he was startled by hearing footsteps
coming toward him. He raised his head,
and saw a young Indian brave, with his blanket
wrapped about his shoulders, carrying a bow in
his hand. His head was ornamented with a bunch
of feathers, and his face was painted with all the
gorgeous hues of savage barbaric art. He recognized
Charles Stevens, for, advancing toward him
with a smile, he extended his hand saying:</p>

<p>"My white brother is not happy. What has
made him sad?"</p>

<p>The Indian was a good judge of human character,
and in the face of the young white man he
read a look of sorrow.</p>

<p>"The white men of Salem are very wicked,
Oracus," said Charles. "Not only are they
wicked to their red brothers, but to their white
brothers, as well. They have taken the old and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
helpless, the weak and forlorn, and put them to
death."</p>

<p>The young savage folded his arms across his
massive chest and stood for a long time in silence.
His eyes were upon the ground, and his stolid
features were without show of emotion. His people
had suffered wrongs at the hands of the white men;
but in this one he had ever found an earnest, true
friend.</p>

<p>There existed between Charles and the brave a
bond of brotherhood as enduring as life. The
young chief inquired what had been done at the
village, and Charles proceeded to tell him all, in
as few words as possible, of the arrest, trial and
execution of Goody Nurse and others. When he
had completed the terrible story, the young chief
drew his blanket about his shoulders and said:</p>

<p>"I am your friend, and if your white brothers
prove false, remember your red brother will be
true."</p>

<p>"I believe you, Oracus."</p>

<p>"I have shown one white brother through the
paths, away from his enemies, and you will always
find Oracus in his forest home ready to befriend
you."</p>

<p>"The time may come when I will need your
aid," said Charles Stevens.</p>

<p>After a long interview, he rose and started home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
He was near the great bridge which spanned the
brook, when he suddenly came upon a tall, powerful
man, whose sallow face and cavalier-like manner
showed him to be a citizen of the southern
colonies. Charles instantly recognized him as Mr.
Joel Martin, the man whom he had seen on that
night with Mr. Parris, Bly and Louder, coming to
arrest Cora's father.</p>

<p>"You are Charles Stevens?" the Virginian said,
halting before the youth.</p>

<p>"I have no desire to deny my name, for it is
that of an honest man; I am Charles Stevens," he
answered.</p>

<p>"Do you know who I am?"</p>

<p>"I suspect you are one whom I saw at my house,
though your name I have not learned."</p>

<p>"I am Joel Martin, and by profession an overseer
on a Virginia plantation. There were but two
of us, my brother and I. He was an overseer of
an adjoining plantation, when one day a slave
escaped. He pursued him and was slain."</p>

<p>"I have heard the story," interrupted Charles.</p>

<p>"You have? and from his own lips?"</p>

<p>"I have; and I do not blame the man who was
seeking liberty. He was a white man, as you yourself
are. He had committed no crime, save that he
was arrested as one of Monmouth's insurgents and
had been captured while in the ranks of the rebel."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>Martin's eyes flashed with fury and, in a voice
that was hoarse, he whispered:</p>

<p>"You aided him to escape; but it shall not
avail. I have for years followed on his trail, and
I will not let go my hold on him, until I have
dragged him to the scaffold. No; the blood of
my brother cries out for vengeance, and I will follow
him day and night through the trackless forests,
until I have brought the renegade to justice.
He cannot conceal himself so deep in the forest,
he cannot hide himself among the savage tribes,
nor burrow so deep in the earth, but that I will
find him."</p>

<p>Charles Stevens turned away and was walking
toward home, when the tall Virginian, by a few
quick strides, overtook him and, laying his hand
on his shoulder, said:</p>

<p>"You do not care to hear these threats; but I
have not done with you yet. Listen; I want to
say more. If you seek to thwart me, I will kill
you. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>"I have no fear of you, Mr. Martin," cried
Charles Stevens, turning on the tall, swarthy southerner
a glance which made him quail. "Your
profession is brutality. You are a stranger to
mercy; yet I will defy you. I fear you not, and,
if you seek my life, you had better take heed for
your own."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>Charles boldly walked away, leaving the discomfited
Virginian to fume and rage alone. The
shades of night were falling fast over the village of
Salem, as Charles hurried homeward, and he was
amazed as he came in sight of the house, to see a
great throng of people going away from the door.
The young man quickened his pace, hardly knowing
whether he was asleep or awake. A negro
slave came running toward him crying:</p>

<p>"Massa! Massa! Massa!"</p>

<p>"What has happened?" asked Charles.</p>

<p>"Um tuk um away! Dey tuk um off!"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Yo mudder."</p>

<p>"My mother! Oh, God!" Charles Stevens ran
swift as a roe buck toward the crowd, which had
now almost reached the jail.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" he demanded of John
Bly, whom he met near the jail.</p>

<p>"Your mother is a witch," Bly answered.</p>

<p>"You lie!" cried Charles, and with one swift,
sure blow, he laid the slanderer senseless at his
feet.</p>

<p>"Hold, Charles Stevens! Hold! Be not rash,
or she may fare worse," whispered a kind voice at
his side, and, turning, he saw the sad face of John
Nurse. He had drunk the bitter cup to its dregs
and could advise. The world seemed swimming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
before the eyes of Charles Stevens. He tried to
rush to that throng, whom he saw dragging both
his mother and Cora Waters to the jail; but in
vain. His feet refused to carry him. He strove
to utter an outcry; but his voice failed, and all
became darkness.</p>

<p>When Charles Stevens regained consciousness,
he was lying on a bed, and kindly faces were bending
over him. He was conscious from the first of
an oppressive weight of trouble, but could not
realize what had occurred. As one awakening
from a troubled dream, he strove to gather up his
scattered faculties and recall what had happened.
Like a blast of doom, the awful truth burst upon
him, and he leaped to his feet. He was at the
home of Landlord Nurse, and the pale, sad, horror-stricken
faces about him were the old gentleman
and his sons and daughters. They caught Charles
before he reached the door.</p>

<p>"My mother!" cried the young man.</p>

<p>"No; you can do her no good by an act of
rashness!" John Nurse answered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me all about it. I will sit here and listen
to it all," said Charles, when he discovered that
he could not break away from his friends.</p>

<p>"Your mother and Cora Waters have both been
cried out upon as witches, warrants were issued,
and they were arrested. Now collect your faculties
and act on your coolest judgment. Think what
you will do."</p>

<p>Charles Stevens bowed his head in his hands
and reflected long and earnestly on the course to
pursue. He recalled the words of Oracus, the
brave young chief, who could muster a hundred
warriors. He was cunning and might devise some
plan of escape, and Charles was not long in resolving
what to do. He would not act hurriedly. He
would be desperate; but that desperation would
have coolness and premeditation about it.</p>

<p>He promised his friends to be calm, assuring
them he would be guarded in his speech, and then
begun seeking an interview with his mother and
Cora. It was three days before the interview was
granted. He found them occupying loathsome
cells, each chained to the wall. The interview
was long, and just what such an interview could
be, full of grief and despair. Charles tried to
hope. He tried to see a ray of sunlight; but the
effort only revealed the swaying forms of those
hung on Witches' Hill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>Even if he summoned Oracus and all his braves,
would they be strong enough to break down that
door of iron, or cut the chains asunder! Charles,
in his desperation, resolved to rescue the beloved
ones or die in the effort. He went away weeping.</p>

<p>He did not return home. That home was desolate,
lonely and so like the tomb, that he dared not
go near it. At the home of his kind friend, he
wrote to relatives at New Plymouth, Boston, New
York, Virginia and the Carolinias. To all he appealed
for help, for Charles was determined to
move heaven and earth or rescue his mother and
Cora; but he did not depend on those distant relatives
and friends so much as the dusky friends in
the forest. He knew that before answers could
come to his letters, he would be dead, or would
have succeeded in his efforts. Even if he should
be killed in an abortive attempt, however, he
hoped that his relatives would resume the warfare
for the prisoners.</p>

<p>"Where is Cora's father?" he asked himself.
"Could I but find the Waters brothers, I would
have two friends and allies to aid me. Oh,
Heaven, give me light! Give me light!"</p>

<p>Charles Stevens, like all true Christians, in this
dark hour went to God for aid. Kneeling, he
prayed as he had never prayed before. He seemed
to take hold of the throne of grace and, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
faith strengthened and renewed, drew inspiration
for his desperate resolve from the only living fountain.
Armed with his rifle and pistols, he left the
village and went into the forest. The forest inspires
man with reverence and love for God. The
giant trees, the deep glens, the moss and ferns and
cool shades seem to breathe of eternity. Charles
Stevens had always loved the dark old woods, and
never had they seemed so friendly as on this occasion,
when they screened him from the frowns of
man.</p>

<p>Solitude offered him its charms. The zephyrs
sought to soothe his sorrows by their gentle whispers,
and the birds sang for the peace of his troubled
spirit, while the babbling brooks strove to
make him gay; but who can be gay when loved
ones are menaced with a terrible danger? Charles
Stevens saw little of the beauty of nature. His
eyes were searching the forests for dusky forms,
which he hoped to meet. Those dusky sons of the
forest were not often desirable sights; but Charles
was as anxious to see the feathers and painted
faces of these heathens, as if they were brothers.</p>

<p>He spent the day in wandering through the
woods, forgetting to take any nourishment, for he
had brought no food with him, and, in fact, he
had not thought to eat since the arrest of his mother
and Cora.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>He was weak and faint, and his hands trembled.
He was not hungry; but his strength was giving
way, and he realized that he had been foolish not
to provide himself with food.</p>

<p>Evening came, and he sank down on the mossy
banks of a stream and took a few draughts of
water to revive him. The stars came out one by
one.</p>

<p>By the merest chance, he raised his despairing
eyes and, gazing across the stream to the woods
beyond, saw a light. Charles struggled to his
feet and gazed like one to whom life has suddenly
been restored.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is Indians!"</p>

<p>He plunged into the creek, waded across and
started through the woods toward the light. It
was much further away than he had at first supposed,
and he was several minutes in reaching the
camp fire.</p>

<p>Ten dusky sons of the forest were seated about
the camp fire, while two men in the garb of civilization
were roving about. Charles felt some misgivings
at first on discovering men of his own color
in the camp. He crawled from tree to tree, from
log to bush, until he was near enough to see the
features of the men. When he first got within
sight they stood with their backs toward him and
he could not see their faces; but at last one turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
about so that the glare of the fire-light fell full on
his face, and, with a cry of joy, Charles Stevens
bounded to his feet, crying:</p>

<p>"Mr. Waters! Mr. Waters!" and dashed toward
the camp.</p>

<p>A pair of strong arms encircled his waist, and
the young man heard a voice say:</p>

<p>"White man go too soon!"</p>

<p>He had been seized by a sentry; but Mr. Waters
and Oracus hastened to him, and he was released.
The other white man was the brother of Mr.
Waters, and Charles, bewildered, overjoyed, yet
faint and weak, was half led and half carried to
the camp. He found himself making hurried explanations,
while a savage was broiling venison
steaks before the fire for him.</p>

<p>"We know all," said Mr. George Waters.</p>

<p>"What! do you know they have been cried out
upon?" asked Charles.</p>

<p>"We do."</p>

<p>"Do you know they are in prison?"</p>

<p>"We have heard it all," said Mr. Waters,
calmly.</p>

<p>"How could you have heard it?" asked Charles.</p>

<p>"We have faithful friends, who inform us of
everything."</p>

<p>"Were you going to take action for their rescue?"
asked Charles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>"We were concerting plans when you came;
but you must have food."</p>

<p>Charles Stevens gazed on the calm face of the man
before him, and could but wonder at his coolness.</p>

<p>"Mr. Waters, do you know that your own
daughter is one of the accused?"</p>

<p>"I know all."</p>

<p>"How can you be so calm, knowing all as you
do?"</p>

<p>"I am calm for my daughter's sake. The only
hope of liberating her, of saving her life, is by
cool, deliberate and well matured plans."</p>

<p>"Are your plans formed?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"When will you act?"</p>

<p>"On to-morrow night. Oracus will have all his
warriors ready by that time, and we will require
crow-bars, hammers and axes, to break in the door
of the jail. Meanwhile, if you expect to aid us,
you will have to take some refreshments, food and
drink, and get some sleep. You don't look as if
you had slept for weeks."</p>

<p>"I scarcely have."</p>

<p>"Your conduct is foolish. If you love your
mother, you should give the full strength of body
and mind to her rescue."</p>

<p>Charles ate some broiled venison and went to
sleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>So exhausted was he, that he did not awake
until the noise of breaking camp aroused him.</p>

<p>Another white man was in camp. His hands
were fastened behind his back and he was tied to
a tree. His sallow complexion and angular features
were familiar to Charles Stevens. The prisoner
was Joel Martin.</p>

<p>"Two of the Indians captured him last night,"
explained George Waters. "He was prowling
about in the woods, and they seized him."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with him?" Charles
asked.</p>

<p>"We will do him no hurt unless we are forced
to," said Mr. Waters.</p>

<p>"I trust you will not be forced," said Charles
Stevens.</p>

<p>"So I pray; yet we must protect ourselves and
those whom we would rescue."</p>

<p>"I see that many more Indians are in camp than
were here yesterday."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Are they friends?"</p>

<p>"They are the braves of Oracus, and will follow
where he leads."</p>

<p>Charles Stevens passed an anxious day. A part
of the time he was near enough to Joel Martin to
hear him muttering:</p>

<p>"I have no fear of George Waters, galley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
slave. You may turn me over to your heathen
cut-throats; yet I will defy you. If I live, I will
yet drag you to justice for the murder of my
brother."</p>

<p>"Mr. Martin, you have forgotten that the word
of God says, 'Vengeance is mine and I will repay,
saith the Lord,'" put in Charles.</p>

<p>"I will be the instrument of vengeance."</p>

<p>"You are in the power of Mr. Waters."</p>

<p>"For the present I am."</p>

<p>"Don't you think you should be careful how
you threaten him, seeing he has you at his mercy."</p>

<p>Charles could not intimidate the bold Virginian.
He was furious, and no threat of punishment could
move him.</p>

<p>During the day, a dozen more Indians came in.
The red men now numbered eighty, and by the
afternoon the entire party was moving toward
Salem.</p>

<p>At dusk they were but five miles from the village.
Here a halt was called, and, after a short
consultation, Oracus detailed five of his braves to
guard Mr. Martin, and with the others moved on
over the hills and through the woods toward Salem.</p>

<p>"What will they do with him?" Charles asked.</p>

<p>"Release him when we leave the village."</p>

<p>"Mr. Waters, would you not be justified in
killing him?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why not? He will murder you if he can."</p>

<p>"No one is justified in slaying a prisoner, and I
shall never do it. No more blood will be on my
hands, unless it be in defence of her. For her, I
slew the other, and only for her will my arm ever
be raised against my fellow man."</p>

<p>"Not even in self defence?"</p>

<p>"No, as God is my judge, my hand shall never
be raised even to defend this miserable life. I live
but for my child, and when she is gone, I care not
how soon I am called. I have known only sorrow
since&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence, but turned away.</p>

<p>It was late in the night when the party entered
Salem. The houses were dark and silent. No
light was visible from any window, and it seemed
a deserted hamlet. Earnestness without excitement
was evinced. Everything was done in perfect
order. The men moved first to the blacksmith
shop, where several supplied themselves with axes,
heavy crow-bars and sledges.</p>

<p>"Explain to your warriors that, under no circumstances,
are they to shed blood," said Mr.
George Waters.</p>

<p>While Oracus was giving this order to his braves,
Mr. Waters, by the aid of a lighted pine knot,
found a pair of cold chisels, which he appropriated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the party moved off toward the jail in perfect
order. There was no undue haste, or nervous
excitement. All seemed as cool as if they were
going as invited guests to a banquet.</p>

<p>The Indians' moccasined feet made scarcely any
noise upon the ground, as they moved forward.
Mr. Henry Waters carried in his hand a stout iron
bar, and twenty Indians bore on their shoulders a
heavy log of wood.</p>

<p>At a word of command from Oracus the others
deployed as flankers and guards. They had strict
orders to harm no one; but, should they find any
attempting to approach them, they were to seize and
hold such persons.</p>

<p>The jail was reached. The long, low wall of
stone, with gates of iron, loomed up like some
sullen monster before the determined men. Mr.
Henry Waters thrust the heavy iron bar he carried
under the iron gate, and tore it off its hinges.</p>

<p>Then George Waters and Charles raised their
sledges, while the savages with the heavy log of
wood ran it like a monster battering-ram against
the door. At the same instant they struck it with
their sledges.</p>

<p>The crash was deafening, and the jail trembled
to its very centre. Again, and again, and again
did those crashing thunder-bolts fall upon the iron
door. The unfortunate inmates, not knowing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
object of this terrible attack, set up a howl which
was heard above the thunder crashes. The door,
stout as it was, could not long withstand that assault.
It gave way with a crash, and fell into the
hall way.</p>

<p>The terrified jailer tumbled out of his bed, only
to find himself seized
and held by a pair of
painted sons of the forest. Others who attempted
to interfere were seized and held in grasps of iron.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 423px;">

title="The jail trembled to its very centre." />
</div>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">The jail trembled to its very centre.</span></p>

<p>No sooner was the door of the jail burst off its
hinges, than George Waters and Charles Stevens,
each with a chisel and hammer, rushed in to cut
the chains of the prisoners.</p>

<p>"Mother! mother! where are you?" cried
Charles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>He had to call several times before the frightened
woman could answer. Then from out the darkness
there came a feeble response. He groped his
way along in the darkness. He found a cell door,
tore it open and reached her side.</p>

<p>At this moment some one lighted a torch within
the jail. A scene, wild, weird and terrible burst
upon their view. The prisoners were almost driven
to madness by the sudden appearance of the savage
and civilized liberators.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens, with chisel and hammer, quickly
cut the chains of his mother and hastened to liberate
Cora. Her father held the light, while he cut the
iron band.</p>

<p>"Free! free!" cried the excited Charles. "Let
us away before the town is roused!"</p>

<p>"No," answered Mr. George Waters; "not while
a prisoner remains to suffer the wrath of prejudice."</p>

<p>Then with chisel and hammer he went from one
to another and cut the iron bands which bound
them.</p>

<p>Oracus and Henry Waters joined him in the
work of liberation, until all were freed.</p>

<p>This required several moments of time, and the
confusion and uproar which they were compelled
to make was rousing the town.</p>

<p>Mr. Parris, half-dressed, ran barefoot through
the town, waving his long arms in the air, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
shouting that the fiends of the air had conspired to
liberate the prisoners. His words and his wild,
fanatical manner tended rather to increase the fear
of the people of Salem, than diminish it. Then
there went out the report through the village that
the Indians had attacked the town, and the people,
roused from their midnight slumbers, magnified
the numbers of the assailants ten to one.</p>

<p>"Cora! Mother!" whispered Charles, "this way!"</p>

<p>He took a hand of each and started to run from
the jail down the street.</p>

<p>Others followed.</p>

<p>"Fly! all of you! Fly for your lives!" cried
Henry Waters, who, now that his work was done,
flung aside his iron bar and sledge.</p>

<p>At a word of command from Oracus his warriors
formed a hollow square about the escaping fugitives,
and moved off as rapidly as they could.</p>

<p>Everybody was bewildered. Everybody running
into the street was asking:</p>

<p>"What has happened? What has gone amiss?"</p>

<p>"They are rescuing the prisoners," shouted Mr.
Parris, wildly. "Don't you see them hurrying
away with them."</p>

<p>He ran to the sheriff and cried:</p>

<p>"Bestir yourself! Do you not see they are taking
your prisoners away?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have no deputies," answered the sheriff.
"They number hundreds, and the Indians are with
them."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! They are only disguised, and are
not a dozen. Come! I will go with you."</p>

<p>Four or five by-standers, being thus emboldened,
offered to go themselves and aid in recovering the
prisoners.</p>

<p>"Come! I will lead you!" cried the eager
preacher, allowing his zeal to overcome his discretion.</p>

<p>They ran after the escaping party, and Mr.
Parris, either being more zealous than the others,
or more swift of foot, outran them and, eluding
some of the Indians, who tried to intercept him,
ran to where Charles Stevens was half leading and
half dragging his mother and Cora from the
village.</p>

<p>"Fire-brand of hades! you shall not escape me,"
cried Mr. Parris seizing Cora's shoulder with a
clutch so fierce as to make her cry out.</p>

<p>Charles released both his mother and Cora, and,
seizing Mr. Parris by the throat, hurled him to
the ground, and raised a hammer to brain him;
but at this moment a strong hand seized his arm,
and the calm, kind voice of Mr. Waters said:</p>

<p>"Stay your hand, Charles. Do the man no
harm."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>Next moment, a pair of dusky hands seized
Mr. Parris, and he was hurried away to the rear.
Mr. Henry Waters caused a couple of guns to be
fired in the air in order to intimidate their pursuers.
This had the desired effect, and the mention
of Indians was sufficient to drive all to the
defense of their homes.</p>

<p>The fugitives reached the forest before the
sheriff and Mr. Parris could get an armed party in
pursuit.</p>

<p>They followed them to the brook, and fired a
volley at them, but in vain. The number of
accused who escaped on that night, has been estimated
at from twenty to one hundred.</p>

<p>The liberated prisoners went whithersoever they
pleased. Some went to Boston, others to Plymouth,
many to New York, New Jersey and Maryland,
while a few returned to England. They
were wearied with their experience in the New
World, and were content to spend their days in
England.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens retained a firm hold on his
mother and Cora, until it was quite evident that
their pursuers had, for the present, at least, given
up the chase. They went on in the forest until
they were joined by the five savages left to guard
Joel Martin. Martin was no longer with them.
Charles did not inquire what had become of him,
for he was wholly engrossed in the safety of Cora
and his mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">MAP OF NORTH AMERICA</span></p>

<p>The Indians and the Waters brothers were engaged
in a consultation. Charles took no part in
the consultation, for he knew nothing to advise.
Then the Indians accompanied them for a few
miles through the woods. The forest was dark
and sombre, and they had only the silent stars to
light their path, until the tardy moon, rising at a
late hour, filled the landscape with silver light.</p>

<p>Day dawned, and they were in a wild, picturesque
wood, with towering hills and stupendous oaks on
every side. Here they halted again for consultation.
Oracus, after giving them all the provisions
he had with him, took his warriors and stole off
into the forest.</p>

<p>George Waters and his brother urged the escaped
prisoners to eat some dried venison and
parched corn and sleep. They did. Indian blankets
on the ground afforded them beds, and their only
covering was the sky.</p>

<p>Charles slept until the afternoon was almost
spent, and then he was awakened by the tramp of
horses feet. He started up and found three Indians
with five horses, saddled and bridled. The
Indians belonged to the braves of Oracus, and,
without a word, they dismounted and turned over
the horses to the Englishmen, and stole away into
the forest.</p>

<p>A few moments later, the white people were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
mounted and riding away through one of the
narrow paths known only to the Waters brothers.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens' soul was too full for him to
give heed to what course they took. His mother
and Cora were free, though he little dreamed that
they were escaping from one danger to another.
They arrived one night at the home of Mr. Dustin,
near Haverhill, in Massachusetts. When the
frontiersman heard their story, he said:</p>

<p>"You are welcome, my persecuted friends, to
the shelter of my roof, so long as it can afford
you any protection; but the war clouds seem to
grow darker and more lowering every moment, and
I don't know how long my roof will afford protection
to any one."</p>

<p>Charles Stevens had been so busy with his own
cares and griefs, that he had forgotten that a terrible
Indian war was raging on the frontier. This
war was known as King William's war, in which
the French joined with the Indians in bringing
fire and sword upon the inhabitants of New England
and New York. The French and English
had long been jealous of each other, and a connected
account need not be given here of all the
disastrous occurrences which lead up to the terrible
assault on Haverhill, where the fugitives from
Salem were stopping.</p>

<p>We will mention, as first of the principal attacks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
during the war of King William, the attack on
Schenectady. This was made in pursuance of a
plan adopted by Count Frontenac, then governor
of Canada, as a means of avenging on the English
Colonies the treatment of King James, deposed by
William and Mary, which had inflamed the resentment
of Frontenac's master, Louis XIV. While
New York was torn with internal strife over
Leisler, the governor of Canada fitted out three
expeditions against the colonies, and in the midst
of winter one was sent against New York. The
attack on Schenectady was the fruit of this expedition.
It was made by a party consisting of about
two hundred French and fifty Caughnewaga Indians,
under command of Maulet and St. Helene,
in 1689 and 1690.</p>

<p>Schenectady was built in the form of an oblong
square with a gate at either extremity. The
enemy found one of the gates not only open, but
unguarded. Although the town was impaled and
might have been protected, there was so little
thought of danger, that no one deemed it necessary
to close the gate. The weather was very cold, and
the English did not suppose an attack would be
made.</p>

<p>It was eleven o'clock and thirty minutes on
Saturday night, February 8th, 1690, when the
enemy entered, divided their party, waylaid every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
portal and began the attack with a terrible war-whoop.
Maulet attacked a garrison, where the
only resistance was made. He soon forced the
gate, slew the soldiers and burned the garrison.
One of the French officers was wounded in forcing a
house; but St. Helene came to his aid, the house
was taken, and all in it were put to the sword.</p>

<p>Naught was now to be seen, save massacre and
pillage on every side, while the most shocking
barbarities were practised on the unfortunate inhabitants.</p>

<p>"Sixty-three houses and the church were immediately
in a blaze," says a contemporaneous writer.
Weak women, in their expiring agonies, saw their
infants cast into the flames, or brained before their
eyes. Sixty-three persons were murdered and
twenty-seven carried into captivity.</p>

<p>A few persons were enabled to escape; but,
being without sufficient clothing, some perished in
the cold before they reached Albany.</p>

<p>About noon next day, the enemy left the desolate
place, taking such plunder as they could carry
with them and destroying the remainder. It was
the intention of Maulet to spare the minister, for
he wanted him as his own prisoner; but he was
found among the mangled dead, and his papers
burned. Two or three houses were spared, while
the others were consigned to the flames.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 394px;">
<img src="images/pillage.jpg" width="394" height="568"
alt="Naught was to be seen, save massacre and pillage on every side."
title="Naught was to be seen, save massacre and pillage on every side." />
</div>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Naught was to be seen, save massacre and pillage on every side.</span></p>

<p>Owing to the wretched condition of the roads
and the deep snows, news of the massacre did not
reach the great Mohawk castle, only seventeen
miles distant, for two days. On receipt of the
terrible news, an armed party set out at once in
pursuit of the foe. After a long tedious march
through the snow and forest, they came upon their
rear, and a furious fight followed, in which about
twenty-five of them were killed and wounded.</p>

<p>A second party of French and Indians was sent
against the delightful settlement of Salmon Falls,
on the Piscataqua. At Three Rivers, Frontenac
had fitted out an expedition of fifty-two men and
twenty-five Indians, with Sieur Hertel as their
leader. In this small band he had three sons and
two nephews. After a long and rugged march,
Hertel reached the place on the 27th of March,
1690. His spies having reconnoitred it, he divided
his men into three companies, leading the largest
himself. Just at dawn of day the attack was made.
The English stoutly resisted, but were unable to
withstand the well-directed fire of their assailants.
Thirty of the bravest defenders fell. The remainder,
amounting to fifty-four, were made prisoners.
The English had twenty-seven houses
reduced to ashes, and two thousand domestic animals
perished in the barns that were burned.</p>

<p>The third party, which was fitted out at Quebec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
by the directions of Frontenac, made an attack upon
Casco, in Maine. The expedition was commanded
by M. De Portneuf. Hertel, on his return to
Canada, met with this expedition, and, joining it
with the force under his command, came back to
the scene of warfare in which he had been so unhappily
successful. As the hostile army marched
through the country of the Abenakis, numbers of
them joined it. Portneuf, with his forces thus
augmented, came into the neighborhood of Casco,
about the 25th of May, 1690. On the following
night, an Englishman who entered the well-laid
ambush was captured and killed. This so excited
the Indians that they raised the war-whoop. Fifty
English soldiers were sent from the fort to ascertain
the occasion of the yelling, and were drawn
into the ambuscade. A volley from the woods on
either side swept them down, and before the remainder
could recover from the panic into which
they were thrown by the volley, they were assailed
with swords, bayonets and tomahawks, and but
four out of the party escaped and these with severe
wounds.</p>

<p>"The English seeing now that they must stand
a siege, abandoned four garrisons, and all retired
into one which was provided with cannon. Before
these were abandoned, an attack was made upon
one of them, in which the French were repulsed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
with an Indian killed and a Frenchman wounded.
Portneuf now began to doubt of his ability to take
Casco, fearing the issue; for his commission only
ordered him to lay waste the English settlements,
and not to attempt fortified places; but, in this
dilemma, Hertel and Hopehood (a celebrated chief
of the tribe of the Kennebec), arrived. It was
now determined to press the siege. In the deserted
forts they found all the necessary tools for carrying
on the work, and they began a mine within fifty
feet of the fort, under a steep bank, which entirely
protected them from its guns. The English became
discouraged, and, on the 28th of May, surrendered
themselves as prisoners of war. There
were seventy men and probably a greater number
of women and children; all of whom, except Captain
Davis, who commanded the garrison, and three
or four others, were given up to the Indians, who
murdered most of them in their most cruel manner;
and, if the accounts be true, Hopehood excelled all
other savages in acts of cruelty."</p>

<p>These barbarous transactions produced both terror
and indignation in New York and New England,
and an attempt at a formidable demonstration
against the enemy was made. The general court
of Massachusetts sent letters of request to the several
executives of the provinces, pursuant to which,
they convened at New York, May 1st, 1661. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
the result of the deliberations, two important measures
were adopted. Connecticut sent General
Winthrop with troops to march through Albany,
there to receive supplies and to be joined by a
body of men from New York. The expedition
was to proceed up Lake Champlain to destroy
Montreal. There was a failure, however, of the
supplies, and this project was defeated. Massachusetts
sent forth a fleet of thirty-four sail, under
William Phipps. He proceeded to Port Royal,
took it, reduced Acadia, and thence sailed up the
St. Lawrence, with the design of capturing Quebec.
The troops landed with some difficulty, and the
place was boldly summoned to surrender. A
proud defiance was returned by Frontenac, as his
position at that time happened to be strengthened by
a re-enforcement from Montreal. Phipps, learning
this, and finding, also, that the party of Winthrop,
which he expected at Montreal, failed, gave
up the attempt, and returned to Boston, with the
loss of several vessels and a considerable number of
troops, for a part of his fleet was wrecked by a storm.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of such trying scenes and
devastation on the part of the French and savages,
that superstition and fanaticism broke loose in
Salem and produced a reign of terror far greater
than that caused by the savages on the frontier.
It was from such scenes to such scenes that Charles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
Stevens, his mother and friends fled. Mr. Dustin
lived near Haverhill, in Massachusetts, and when
they appealed to him for shelter and protection
he said:</p>

<p>"To such as I have you are welcome; but, I
assure you, it is poor. The savage scalping-knife
may be more dangerous than the fanatic's noose in
Salem."</p>

<p>They had been at Haverhill but a few weeks,
when, as Charles and Mr. Henry Waters were one
day returning from a hunt, they discovered a man
trailing them.</p>

<p>"It's a white man," Charles remarked.</p>

<p>"So I perceive, and why should he trail us?"
Henry Waters asked.</p>

<p>"I know not; but let us ascertain."</p>

<p>They halted at the creek near Haverhill, and
were sitting on the banks of the stream, when a
voice from the rocks above demanded their surrender.</p>

<p>Looking up, they found themselves covered with
three rifles. Three white men, one of whom they
recognized as Mr. Joel Martin, the Virginian,
stepped out from behind the rocks and advanced
toward them, assuring them that any effort to escape,
or resist would result in instant death.</p>

<p>"I have you at last, murderer!" cried Martin,
seizing Henry Waters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, you mistake&mdash;&mdash;" began Charles; but
Henry Waters signed him to keep quiet. The
Waters brothers, as the reader is aware, were twins
and looked so much alike, that it was difficult to
distinguish one from the other.</p>

<p>Charles was not slow to grasp at the idea of
Henry Waters. He would suffer himself to be
taken to Virginia in his brother's stead, where he
would make his identity known and establish an
alibi; but there was danger of the revengeful Martin
killing his prisoner before he reached Virginia,
and Charles said:</p>

<p>"Will you promise, on your honor as a Virginian,
not to harm the prisoner until he reaches a court
of justice?"</p>

<p>The Virginian gave his promise, and then the
three led Mr. Waters hurriedly away, mounted
horses, hastened to Boston and took a vessel for
Virginia.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens went to Mr. George Waters and
told him what had happened. Mr. Waters' face
grew troubled; but he said nothing.</p>

<p>That night there was an alarm of savages in the
neighborhood and Charles Stevens and Mr. Waters
went with a train-band to meet the foe. In a
skirmish, Mr. Waters was wounded, and it was
thought best for him to go to Boston for medical
treatment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have friends and relatives there," Charles
said, "and we might be safe."</p>

<p>Next day the four secretly set out for Boston,
where they lodged for awhile with some relatives
of Charles and his mother, who kept their presence
a secret.</p>

<p>Before concluding this chapter, it is the duty of
the author, although stepping aside from the narrative,
to relate what befell their brave friends, the
Dustins, during the progress of King William's
war. The atrocities committed upon the colonists
by the French and Indians were equal to any recorded
in the annals of barbarous ages. Connected
with these were instances of heroic valor on the
part of the heroic sufferers, which are not surpassed.
On March 15th, 1697, the last year of
King William's war, an attack was suddenly made
on Haverhill by a party of about twenty Indians.
It was a rapid, but fatal onset, and a fitting <i>finale</i>
of so dreadful a ten years' war. Eight houses were
destroyed, twenty-seven persons killed, and thirteen
carried away prisoners. One of these houses,
standing in the outskirts of the village and, in fact,
over the hill, so as to be almost out of sight of the
people in the town, was the home of Mr. Dustin,
the house which had afforded shelter to the fugitives
from the Salem witchcraft persecution.</p>

<p>On that fatal morning, Mr. Dustin had gone to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
the field to commence his spring work. The season
was early, and the plow and shovel had already
begun to turn over the rich, black soil. The industrious
farmer had but just harnessed his horse,
when the animal began to sniff the air, and, turning
his eyes toward some bushes, Mr. Dustin discovered
two painted faces, with heads adorned by
feathers.</p>

<p>At the same moment, a rattling crash of firearms
and the terrible war-whoop announced the
attack on Haverhill. He unharnessed his horse,
seized his gun, which he always kept near at hand,
and galloped away like the wind toward the house,
pursued by arrows of the Indians.</p>

<p>Reaching the house before the Indians, he cried
to his family to fly, and he would cover their
retreat.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Neff, take Mrs. Dustin and fly for your
lives," he cried.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dustin had an infant, but a few days old,
and was confined to her bed. Mrs. Neff was her
nurse. The husband made an attempt to remove
his wife; but it was too late. The Indians, like
ravenous wolves, were rushing on the house. Mrs.
Dustin turned to her husband and said:</p>

<p>"Go, Thomas, you cannot save me, go and save
the children."</p>

<p>Moved by her urgent appeal, he leaped on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
horse and, with his gun in his hand, galloped away
after the children, seven in number, who were
already running down the road. The first thought
of the father was to seize one, place it on the horse
before him, and escape; but he was unable to
select one from the others. All were alike dear to
him, and he resolved to defend all or perish in
the effort. They had reached a point below the
town, where the road ran between two hills in a
narrow pass. A party of Indians, eleven in number,
had seen the children and were running after
them. Mr. Dustin spurred his horse between the
children and the savage foe, and shouting to his
darlings to fly, and bidding the oldest carry the
youngest, he drew rein at the pass and cocked
his gun. Thomas Dustin was a dead shot, and
his rifle was the best made at that day.</p>

<p>Facing the savages, he fired and shot the leader
dead in his tracks. His followers were appalled
at the fate of their brawny chieftain, and for a
moment hesitated. Mr. Dustin hesitated not a
single instant, but proceeded, without a moment's
delay, to reload his gun. Five of the Indians fired
at the resolute father, as he rode away after his
flying children.</p>

<p>"Run! run! run for your lives!" he shouted.</p>

<p>The Indians, with a whoop of vengeance followed
the father. He had four balls in his gun,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
and, wheeling his horse about, he fired this terrible
charge at them. Though none were killed instantly
at this shot, three were wounded, two so severely
that they died next day. The Indians abandoned
the pursuit of the resolute father, who continued
to fight as he retreated, and turned their attention
to less dangerous victories, so Mr. Dustin escaped
with his children.</p>

<p>Mrs. Neff, the nurse in attendance on Mrs.
Dustin, heroically resolved to share the fate of her
patient, even when she could have escaped. The
Indians entered the house, and, having made the
sick woman rise and sit quietly in the corner of
the fire-place, they pillaged the dwelling, and set
it on fire, taking the occupants out of it. At the
approach of night, Mrs. Dustin was forced to march
into the wilderness and seek repose on the hard,
cold ground. Mrs. Neff attempted to escape with
the baby, but was intercepted. The infant had
its brains beaten out against a tree, and the body
was thrown into the bushes. The captives of
Haverhill, when collected, were thirteen miserable,
wretched people. That same day they were
marched twelve miles before camping, although it
was nearly night before they set out. Succeeding
this, for several days they were compelled to keep
up with the savage captors, over an extent of country
of not less than one hundred and forty or fifty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
miles. Feeble as she was, it seems wonderful that
Mrs. Dustin should have borne up under the trials
and fatigues of the journey; but she did.</p>

title="The resolute father continued to fire as he retreated." />
</div>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">The resolute father continued to fire as he retreated.</span></p>

<p>After this, the Indians, according to their custom,
divided their prisoners. Mrs. Dustin, Mrs.
Neff and a captive lad from Worcester fell to the
share of an Indian family consisting of twelve persons.
These now took charge of the captives and
treated them with no particular unkindness, save
that of forcing them to extend their journey still
further toward an Indian settlement. One day
they told the prisoners that there was one ceremony
to which they must submit after their arrival at
their destination, and that was running the gauntlet
between two files of Indians. This announcement
filled Mrs. Dustin and her companions with
so much dread, that they mutually resolved to
make a desperate attempt to escape.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hannah Dustin, Mrs. Mary Neff the nurse,
and the lad Samuel Leonardson, only eleven years
of age, were certainly not persons to excite the fear
of a dozen sturdy warriors. The Indians believed
the lad faithful to them, and never dreamed that
the women would have courage enough to attempt
to escape, and no strict watch was kept over them.</p>

<p>In order to throw the savage captors off their
guard, Mrs. Dustin seemed to take well to
them, and on the day before the plan of escape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
was carried out, she ascertained, through inquiries
made by the lad, how to kill a man instantly and
how to take off his scalp.</p>

<p>"Strike him here," the Indian explained, placing
his finger on his temple, "and take off his
scalp so," showing the lad how it was done. With
this information, the plot was ripe. Just before
dawn of day, when the Indians sleep most profound,
Mrs. Dustin softly rose from her bed of
earth and touched Mary Neff on the shoulder. A
single touch was sufficient to awake her, and she
sat up. Next the lad had to be aroused. Being
young and wearied, his slumbers were profound.
An Indian lay near asleep. Mrs. Dustin seized
his tomahawk, and Mrs. Neff seized another Indian's
weapons. The nurse shook Samuel. The
lad rose, rubbed his eyes and went over to where
the man lay, who had instructed him in the art of
killing. He seized his hatchet and held it in his
hand ready. At a signal from Mrs. Dustin, three
blows fell on three temples, and with a quiver three
sleepers in life had passed to the sleep of death.
Once more the hatchets were raised, and six of the
twelve were dead. The little noise they were
compelled to make disturbed the slumbers of the
others, and the three hatchets, now red with blood,
fell on three more. Mrs. Neff, growing nervous
and excited, cut her man's head a little too far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
forward, and he started up with a yell. The blood
blinded him, however, and she stabbed him.</p>

<p>The yell had roused the others, and a squaw
with a child fled to the woods, while the tenth, a
young warrior, was assailed by Mrs. Dustin and
the lad and slain ere he was fully awake. Ten of
the twelve were dead, and the escaped prisoners,
after scuttling all the boats save one, to prevent
pursuit, started in that down the river, with what
provisions they could take from the Indians. They
had not gone far, when Mrs. Dustin said:</p>

<p>"We have not scalped the Indians."</p>

<p>"Why should we?" asked Mrs. Neff.</p>

<p>"When we get home and tell our friends that
we three slew ten Indians, they will demand some
proof of the assertion, and the ten scalps will be
proof."</p>

<p>Samuel Leonardson, boy like, was anxious to
have the scalps of his foes, and so they overruled
Mrs. Neff and, turning about, went back to the
camp which was now deserted save by the ghastly
dead, their glassy eyes gazing upward at the skies.</p>

<p>"This is the way he told me to do it," said
Samuel, seizing the tuft of hair on the head of the
man who had instructed him in scalping. He ran
the keen edge of a knife around the skull and, by
a quick jerk, pulled off the scalp.</p>

<p>Being novices in the art, it took them some time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
to remove the scalps from the heads of all; but
the bloody task was finally accomplished and putting
the scalps in a bag, they once more embarked
in the Indian canoe and started down the
stream.</p>

<p>"With strong hearts, the three voyagers went
down the Merrimac to their homes, every moment
in peril from savages or the elements, and were
received as persons risen from the dead. Mrs.
Dustin found her husband and children saved.
Soon after, she went to Boston, carrying with her
a gun and tomahawk, which she had brought from
the wigwam, and her ten trophies, and the general
court of Massachusetts gave these brave sufferers
fifty pounds as a reward for their heroism. Ex-Governor
Nicholson, of Maryland, sent a metal
tankard to Mrs. Dustin and Mrs. Neff, as a token
of his admiration. That tankard is now (1875) in
the possession of Mr. Emry Coffin, of Newburyport,
Massachusetts. During the summer of 1874,
one hundred and seventy-seven years after the
event, citizens of Massachusetts and New Hampshire
erected on the highest point of Dustin's Island
an elegant monument, commemorative of the heroic
deed. It displays a figure of Mrs. Dustin, holding
in her right hand, raised in the attitude of striking,
a tomahawk, and a bunch of scalps in the other.
On it are inscribed the names of Hannah Dustin,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>

<p>Haverhill was a second time attacked and desolated
during King William's war, and other places
suffered. The treaty at Ryswick, a village near
the Hague, in Holland, soon after, put an end to
the indiscriminate slaughter in Europe and America.
At this insignificant little village, a peace
was agreed upon between Louis XIV. of France
and England, Spain and Holland, and the German
Empire, which ended a war of more than seven
years' duration. Louis was compelled to acknowledge
William of Orange to be the sovereign of
England. That war cost Great Britain one hundred
and fifty millions of dollars in cash, besides
a hundred millions loaned. The latter laid the
foundation of England's enormous national debt,
which, to-day, amounts to five thousand millions
of dollars.</p>

<p>Prior to the treaty at Ryswick, a Board of Trade
and Plantations was established in England, whose
duty it was to have a general oversight of the
affairs of the American colonies. It was a permanent
commission, the members of which were
called "Lords of Trade and Plantations." It consisted
of seven members, with a president, and was
always a ready instrument of oppression in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
hands of the sovereign, and became a powerful
promoter of those discontents in the colonies, which
broke out in open rebellion in 1775.</p>

<p>The peace of Ryswick was of short duration.
Aspirants for power again tormented the people
with the evils of war. King James II. died in
France, September, 1701. He had been shielded
by Louis after his flight from his throne to France,
and now the French monarch acknowledged James'
son, James Francis Edward (known in history as
the pretender) to be the lawful king of England.
This act greatly offended the English, because the
crown had been settled upon Anne, James' second
Protestant daughter. Louis, in addition, had offended
the English by placing his grandson, Philip
of Anjou, on the throne of Spain, so increasing
the influence of France among the dynasties of
Europe. King William was enraged and was preparing
for war, when a fall from his horse, while
hunting, caused his death. He was succeeded by
Anne, and a war ensued, which lasted almost a
dozen years and is known in history as Queen
Anne's War. We have, however, too long dwelt
on the general history of the country. It will be
essential to our story that we return to the village
of Salem where superstition was reigning, while
the chief characters of our story were resting in
security at Boston, not daring to go abroad by day.</p>

<p>After the escape of Mrs. Stevens and Cora
Waters, a wave of superstition swept over the
village of Salem with such irresistible fury, that it
seemed in greater danger than the frontier settlements
did from the French and Indians. The
Nurse family and all their relatives came in for a
greater share than any other. Mrs. Cloyse was
second of the family to be accused by Parris and
his minions. Mrs. Cloyse drew ill-will upon herself
at the outset by doing as her brother and sister
Nurse did. They all absented themselves from
the examinations in the church, and, when the interruptions
of the services became too flagrant,
from Sabbath worship. They declared that they
took that course, because they disapproved of the
permission given to the profanation of the place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
and the service. At last Mrs. Cloyse, or Goody
Cloyse, as she was called in the records of the day,
was arrested. Mary Easty and Elizabeth Proctor
were also arrested. Mary Easty, sister of Mrs.
Nurse, was tried and condemned. On her condemnation
and sentence, she made an affective
memorial while under sentence of death, and fully
aware of the hopelessness of her case, addressing
the judges, the magistrates and the reverend ministers,
imploring them to consider what they were
doing, and how far their course in regard to accused
persons was inconsistent with the principles
and rules of justice.</p>

<p>"I ask nothing for myself," she said. "I am
satisfied with my own innocence and certain of my
doom on earth and my hope in Heaven. What I
do desire, is to induce the authorities to take time,
and to use caution in receiving and strictness in
sifting testimony; and so shall they ascertain the
truth, and absolve the innocent, the blessing of
God being upon your conscientious endeavors."</p>

<p>No effect was produced by her warnings or remonstrances.
Before setting forth from the jail to
the Witches' Hill on the day of her death, she
serenely bade farewell to her husband and many
children, and many of her friends, some of whom
afterward related that "her sayings were so serious,
religious, distinct and affectionate as could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
well be expressed, drawing tears from the eyes of
all present."</p>

<p>The subject of witchcraft grew more interesting
after the execution of Mary Easty, and to examine
Elizabeth Proctor and Sarah Cloyse, or Cloyce, as
Mr. Bancroft spells the name, the deputy governor
and five magistrates went to Salem. It was a great
day. Several ministers were present. Parris officiated,
and, by his own record, it is plain that he
himself elicited every accusation. His first witness
John, the West India negro servant, husband to
Tituba, was rebuked by Sarah Cloyse as a grievous
liar. Abigail Williams, the niece to Parris, was
also at hand with her wonderful tales of sorcery.
She swore she had seen the prisoner at the witches'
sacrament.</p>

<p>Struck with horror at such bold perjury, Sarah
Cloyse called for water and swooned away before
it could be brought her. Upon this, Abigail Williams,
her brother's wife, Sarah Williams, Parris'
daughter and Ann Putnam shouted:</p>

<p>"Her spirit is gone to prison to her sister!"</p>

<p>Against Elizabeth Proctor, Abigail Williams
related stories that were so foolish that one wonders
how any sensible person could believe them.
Among other things she told how the accused had
invited her to sign the Devil's book.</p>

<p>"Dear child!" exclaimed the accused, in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
agony, "it is not so. There is another judgment,
dear child," and her accusers, turning toward her
husband, declared that he, too, was a wizard.
All three were committed. Examinations and
commitments multiplied. Giles Corey, a stubborn
old man of more than four-score years, could not
escape the malice of his minister and his angry
neighbors, with whom he had
quarrelled. Parris had had a
rival in George Burroughs, a
graduate of Harvard College,
who, having formerly preached
in Salem village, had
friends there desirous of his
return. He was a skeptic on
the subject of witchcraft, and
Parris determined to have his
revenge on him, and, through
his many agents and instruments,
had him accused and
committed. Thus far there had been no success
in obtaining confessions, though earnestly solicited.
It had been strongly hinted that a confession was
an avenue of safety. At last, "Deliverance Hobbs
owned every thing that was asked of her," and
left unharmed. The gallows was to be set up,
not for those who professed themselves witches,
but for those who rebuked the delusion.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Lieut.-Gov. Stoughton</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
On May 14th, the new charter and the royal
governor arrived in Boston. On the next Monday,
the charter was published, and the parishioner of
Cotton Mather, with the royal council, was installed
in office. The triumph of Cotton Mather
was complete. A court of oyer and terminer was
immediately instituted by ordinance, and the positive,
overbearing Stoughton was appointed by the
governor and council as its chief judge, with Sewall
and Wait Winthrop, two feebler men, as his associates.
By the second of June, the court was in
session at Salem, making its experiment on Bridget
Bishop, a poor and friendless old woman. The
fact of witchcraft was assumed as "notorious."
To fix it on the prisoner, Samuel Parris, who had
examined her before her commitment, was the
principal witness to her power of inflicting torture.
He had seen it exercised. Then came the testimony
of the bewitched, and a terrible mess of stuff it was.
One, on reading it, might suppose that all the inmates
of Bedlam had been summoned into court to give
their personal experience in the land of insanity.</p>

<p>Many of the witnesses testified that the "shape"
of the prisoner often grievously tormented them,
by pinching, choking, or biting them, and did
otherwise seriously afflict them, urging them all
the while to write their names in a book, which
"the spectre" called: "Our book."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>Sarah Williams, who was devotedly attached to
Mr. Parris and his cause, swore that it was the
shape of this prisoner, with Cora Waters, which
one day took her from her wheel and, carrying
her to the river side, threatened to drown her, if
she did not sign the book mentioned, which she
yet refused to do.</p>

<p>Others said that the witch "in her shape," that
is, appearing to them in a spiritual body invisible
to any save the parties before whom she would
appear, boasted that she had ridden John Bly, having
first changed him into a horse. One testified
to seeing ghosts of dead people, who declared that
Bridget Bishop had murdered them.</p>

<p>While the examination of the accused was in
progress, the bewitched seemed extremely tortured.
If she turned her eyes on them, they were struck
down. While they lay in swoons or convulsions,
the poor old woman was made to touch them, and
they immediately sprang to their feet. Samuel
Parris had his minions well trained. On any
special action of her body, shaking of her head, or
the turning of her eyes, they imitated her posture
and seemed under some strange spell.</p>

<p>Evidence was given that one of the bewitched
persons persuaded a man to strike at the spot
where the "shape of this Bishop stood," and the
bewitched cried out:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have tore her coat," and it was found that
the woman's dress was torn in the very place.</p>

<p>Deliverance Hobbs, who had confessed to being
a witch, now testified that she was tormented by
the spectres for her confession. And she now testified
that this Bishop tempted her to sign the book
again, and to deny what she had confessed.</p>

<p>"It was the shape of this prisoner," she declared,
"which whipped me with iron rods, to
compel me thereunto, and I furthermore saw
Bridget Bishop at a general meeting of the witches,
in a field at Salem village, where they partook of
a diabolical sacrament in bread and wine, then
administered."</p>

<p>John Cook testified: "About five or six years
ago, one morning, about sunrise, I was in my
chamber assaulted by the shape of this prisoner,
which looked on me, grinned at me, and very
much hurt me with a blow on the side of the head,
and on the same day, about noon, the same shape
walked into the room where I was, and an apple
strangely flew out of my hand."</p>

<p>Samuel Gray testified: "About fourteen years
ago, I waked on a night, and saw the room wherein
I lay full of light. Then I plainly saw a woman,
between the cradle and the bedside, which
looked upon me. I rose, and it vanished, though
I found all the doors fast. Looking out at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
entry door, I saw the same woman, in the same
garb again, and I said, 'In God's name, what do
you come for?' I went to bed and had the same
woman again assaulting me. The child in the
cradle gave a great screech, and the woman disappeared.
It was long before the child could be
quieted; and, though it was a very likely, thriving
child, yet from this time it pined away, and,
after divers months, died in a sad condition. I
knew not Bishop then, nor her name; but when I
saw her after this, I knew her by her countenance
and apparel and all circumstances, that it was the
apparition of this Bishop, which had thus troubled
me."</p>

<p>John Bly testified:</p>

<p>"I bought a sow of Edmund Bishop, the husband
of the prisoner, and was to pay the price
agreed upon to another person. This prisoner,
being angry that she was thus hindered from fingering
the money, quarrelled with me; soon after
which the sow was taken with strange fits, jumping,
leaping and knocking her head against the
fence. She seemed blind and deaf and could not
eat, whereupon my neighbor John Louder said he
believed the creature was overlooked, and there
were sundry other circumstances concurred, which
made me believe that Bishop had bewitched it."</p>

<p>The examining magistrates asked Bly:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you ever been transformed by the prisoner?"</p>

<p>"I have," Bly answered.</p>

<p>"When was it?"</p>

<p>"Last summer. One night, as I was coming
home late, the shape of the prisoner came at me.
She shook a bridle over my head and I became a
horse. Then she mounted me, rode me several
leagues and the bridle was removed, and I lay in
my bed."</p>

<p>John Louder, another acquaintance of Charles
Stevens, was next called. John had had his experience
with witches. He was an ardent admirer
of Mr. Parris, and one of his emissaries. Louder,
Bly and, in fact, all of Parris' tools were ignorant,
bigoted and superstitious. They could be made
to believe anything the pastor would tell them.
Louder testified:</p>

<p>"I had some little controversy with Bishop about
her fowls. Going well to bed, I did awake in the
night by moonlight, and did see clearly the likeness
of this woman grievously oppressing me; in
which miserable condition she held me, unable to
help myself till near day. I told Bishop of this;
but she denied it, and threatened me very much.
Quickly after this, being at home on a Lord's Day,
with the doors shut about me, I saw a black pig
approach me, at which I, going to kick, it vanished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
away. Immediately after sitting down, I saw a
black thing jump in at the window and come and
stand before me. The body was like that of a
monkey, the feet like a cock's; but the face was
much like a man's. I was so extremely affrighted,
that I could not speak. This monster spoke to
me and said:</p>

<p>"'I am a messenger sent unto you, for I understand
that you are in some trouble of mind, and if
you be ruled by me, you shall want for nothing in
this world.'</p>

<p>"Whereupon, I endeavored to clap my hands
upon it; but I could feel no substance; and it
jumped out of the window again; but it immediately
came in by the porch, though the doors were
shut, and said:</p>

<p>"'You had better take my counsel.'</p>

<p>"Whereupon, I struck at it with my stick, but
struck only the ground-sel, and broke my stick.
The arm with which I struck was presently disenabled,
and it vanished away. I presently went
out at the porch door and spied this Bishop, in her
orchard, going toward her house; but I had not
power to set one foot forward unto her. Whereupon,
returning into the house, I was immediately
accosted by the monster I had seen before, which
goblin was now going to fly at me; whereat I did
cry out:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>"'The whole armor of God be between me
and you!'</p>

<p>"So it sprang back and flew over the apple tree,
shaking many apples off the tree in its flying over.
At its leap, it flung dirt with its feet against my
stomach, whereon, I was then struck dumb, and
so continued for three days together."</p>

<p>The records of the case on trial shows that William
Stacy testified:</p>

<p>"I received money of this Bishop for work done
by me, and I was gone but a matter of three rods
from her, when, looking for my money, I found it
unaccountably gone from me. Some time after,
Bishop asked me if my father would grind her
grist for her? I demanded why not?</p>

<p>"'Because folks count me a witch.'</p>

<p>"I answered:</p>

<p>"'No question but he will grind for you.'</p>

<p>"Being gone about six rods from her, with a
small load in my cart, suddenly the off wheel
stumped and sank down into a hole, upon plain
ground, so that I was forced to get help for the
recovering of the wheel; but, stepping back to
look for the hole which might give me this disaster,
there was none at all to be found. Some time
after, I was waked in the night; but it seemed as
light as day, and I perfectly saw the shape of this
Bishop in the room, troubling me; but upon her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
going out, all was dark again. When I afterward
charged Bishop with it, she did not deny it, but
was very angry. Quickly after this, having been
threatened by Bishop, as I was again in a dark
night, going to the barn, I was very suddenly
taken or lifted from the ground, and thrown against
a stone wall. After that, I was hoisted up and
thrown down a bank, at the end of my house.
After this, again passing by this Bishop, my horse
with a small load, striving to draw, all his gears
flew to pieces, and the cart fell down, and I, going
to lift a bag of corn, of about two bushels, could
not budge it."</p>

<p>The foregoing is a sample of the testimony on
which people were hung. We have given these,
that the reader may see what firm hold Mr. Parris
and superstition had on the people. We could
give page after page of this testimony; but the
above is sufficient. If the reader wants a fuller
account of the trials of Bishop, Martin or any of
the unfortunates who suffered death at Salem during
the reign of superstition, we refer them to the
collections of Cotton Mather in his "Invisible
World." From that book we quote the following
information, as elicited by the examination in case
of Susanna Martin, at Salem, June 29th, 1692:</p>

<p>Magistrate.&mdash;"Pray, what ails these people?"</p>

<p>Martin.&mdash;"I don't know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>Magistrate.&mdash;"But what do you think of
them?"</p>

<p>Martin.&mdash;"I don't desire to spend my judgment
upon it."</p>

<p>Magistrate.&mdash;"Don't you think they are bewitched?"</p>

<p>Martin.&mdash;"No; I do not think they are."</p>

<p>Magistrate.&mdash;"Tell us your thoughts about
them."</p>

<p>Martin.&mdash;"No; my thoughts are my own, when
they are in; but when they are out, they are
another's. Their master&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Magistrate.&mdash;"Their master? Whom do you
think is their master?"</p>

<p>Martin.&mdash;"If they be dealing in the black art,
you may know as well as I."</p>

<p>Magistrate.&mdash;"Well, what have you done toward
this?"</p>

<p>Martin.&mdash;"Nothing at all."</p>

<p>Magistrate.&mdash;"Why, 'tis you, or your appearance."</p>

<p>Martin.&mdash;"I cannot help it."</p>

<p>Magistrate.&mdash;"If it be not your master, how
comes your appearance to hurt these?"</p>

<p>Martin.&mdash;"How do I know? He that appeared
in the shape of Samuel, a glorified saint, may appear
in any one's shape."</p>

<p>No wonder that a writer having occasion to examine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
into the evidence a few years ago, and commenting
on it, should exclaim:</p>

<p>"Great God! and is this the road our ancestors
had to travel in their pilgrimage in quest of freedom
and Christianity? Are these the misunderstood
doctrines of total depravity?"</p>

<p>Reverend Mr. Noyes seemed to rival Mr. Parris
in the persecution of witches.</p>

<p>"You are a witch. You know you are," he
said to Sarah Good, while urging her to confession.</p>

<p>"You are a liar," the poor woman replied,
"and, if you take my life, God will give you blood
to drink."</p>

<p>Confessions became important in the prosecutions.
Some, not afflicted before confession, were
so, presently, after it. The jails were filled; for
fresh accusations were needed to confirm the confessions.
Mr. Hale says:</p>

<p>"Some, by these their accusations of others,
hoped to gain time, and get favor from the rulers.
Some of the inferior sort of people did ill offices,
by promising favor thereby, more than they had
ground to engage. Some, under these temptations,
regarded not as they should what became of others,
so that they could thereby serve their own turns.
Some have since acknowledged so much. If the
confessions were contradictory; if witnesses uttered
apparent falsehoods, 'the Devil,' the judges would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
say, 'takes away their memory, and imposes on
their brain.'"</p>

<p>Who, under such circumstances, would dare to
be skeptical, or refuse to believe the confessors?
Already, twenty persons had been put to death for
witchcraft. Fifty-five had been tortured or terrified
into penitent confessions. With accusations,
confessions increased; with confessions, new accusations.
Even "the generation of the children of
God" were in danger of "falling under that condemnation."
The jails were full. One hundred
and fifty prisoners awaited trial, two hundred more
were accused or suspected. It was also observed
that no one of the condemned confessing witchcraft
had been hanged. No one that confessed, and
retracted a confession, had escaped either hanging
or imprisonment for trial. No one of the condemned
who asserted innocence, even if one of the
witnesses confessed to perjury, or the foreman of
the jury acknowledged the error of the verdict,
escaped the gallows. Favoritism was shown in
listening to accusations, which were turned aside
from friends or partisans. If a man began a career
as a witch-hunter, and, becoming convinced of
the imposture, declined the service, he was accused
and hanged.</p>

<p>Samuel Parris had played a strong hand and was
more than successful. His harvest of vengeance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
seemed to have no end. Witches' Hill became a
Tyburn-hill, and as many as eight were hung at
one time.</p>

<p>Matters had at last gone too far. The delusion
reached its climax in the midsummer of 1692, and
on the second Wednesday in October following,
about a fortnight after the last hanging at Salem,
the representatives of the colony assembled, and
the people of Andover, their minister joining with
them, appeared with their remonstrance against the
doings of witch tribunals.</p>

<p>"We know not," they said, "who can think
himself safe, if the accusation of children and
others under a diabolical influence shall be received
against persons of good fame." The discussions
which ensued were warm, for Mr. Parris
had defenders even in the legislature, who denounced
Charles and Hattie Stevens "as murderers
and exercisers of the black art." The general
court did not place itself in direct opposition to
the advocates of the trials. It ordered by bill a
convocation of ministers, that the people might be
led in the right way, as to the witchcraft. The
reason for doing it and the manner were such,
that the judges of the court, so wrote one of them,
"consider themselves thereby dismissed." As to
legislature, it adopted what King William rejected&mdash;the
English law, word for word, as it was enacted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
by a house of commons, in which Coke and
Bacon were the guiding minds; but they abrogated
the special court, and established a tribunal by
statute. Phipps had, instantly on his arrival,
employed his illegal court in hanging the witches.
The representatives of the people delayed the first
assembling of the legal court till January of the
following year. Thus an interval of more than
three months from the last executions gave the
public mind security and freedom. Though Phipps
conferred the place of chief judge on Stoughton,
yet jurors, representing the public mind, acted
independently. When the court met at Salem, six
women of Andover, at once renouncing their confessions,
treated the witchcraft but as something
"so called," the bewildered but as "seemingly
afflicted." A memorial of like tenor come from the
inhabitants of Andover.</p>

<p>More than one-half of the cases presented were
dismissed; and, though bills were found against
twenty-six persons, the trials showed the feebleness
of the testimony on which others had been condemned.
The minds of the juries had become enlightened,
even before the prejudiced judges. The
same testimony was produced, and there at Salem,
with Stoughton on the bench, verdicts of acquittal
followed.</p>

<p>One of the parties acquitted on this occasion was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
an old acquaintance. Mr. Henry Waters, who
had been arrested for his brother and taken to Virginia,
suddenly appeared in Salem. John Louder,
at once cried out against him and caused him to be
arrested. On being arraigned, he plead not guilty
and was put on his trial. John Louder was the
principal witness. He stated that one day he and
Bly were hunting and that defendant pursued them
and bewitched their guns. Then he testified that
he fired a silver bullet and wounded the defendant.
He also testified to his appearing before him on
the evening he went to stalk deer, and offering him
a book to sign. It was known that the accused
had suffered from a wound.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters then proceeded to explain:</p>

<p>"My name is Henry Waters, and, in early life,
my brother and I were players. We were members
of the Church of England and detested the
Catholic Religion. The end of Charles II. was
drawing near, and we reasoned that James II., his
brother, would become heir to the throne. Our
only hope was to organize a strong party and seize
the throne for the Duke of Monmouth. I was sent
to the American colonies to secure pledges of support,
and get the names of all who would resist
a papal monarch on my book. I came, leaving
my brother and his child in England. On the
way here, I was suddenly fired upon by an Indian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
in ambush and wounded in the side. As these
men were stalking a deer I passed along and affrighted
the animal, so it ran away, and I was for
this accused of being a wizard."</p>

<p>He was then asked by the examining magistrate,
if he did offer a book to Mr. John Louder to sign.</p>

<p>"I did," he quickly answered.</p>

<p>"When was it?"</p>

<p>"At the time and place he states."</p>

<p>"What book was it?"</p>

<p>"I have it here," and he produced a small, red-backed
blank book. "This has caused so much
trouble. Examine it, and you will see it was to
contain only the names of those who would resist
the accession of the Duke of York to the throne."</p>

<p>The book was passed around to the Judge and
Jury, and a smile dawned on the face of each,
which was dangerous to the friends of the prosecution.
That book would have hung Henry
Waters during the reign of James II.; but now it
was his salvation. He was one of the first acquitted.
The delusion was on the wane. "Error
died among its worshippers."</p>

<p>Charles Stevens, his mother and Cora and
her wounded father found safety and shelter at the
home of Richard Stevens in Boston. Richard
Stevens was an uncle to Charles, and a man past
middle life, but noted for his practical common
sense. Like all others of this noted family, he
never rose high in either social or political circles.
They were simply farmers or small tradesmen, with
more than average intelligence, patriotic and honest
as their great progenitor, who came over with
Columbus.</p>

<p>Richard Stevens knew that the delusion of
witchcraft could not last. In his house, which was
among the best in Boston, save those occupied by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
the governors and officers, the fugitives, save Mr.
Waters, remained all during the latter part of 1692.
As soon as his wound was healed, George Waters,
mysteriously disappeared. He reached Williamsburg,
Va., just after his brother was acquitted.
He did not meet with Henry, for he had already
taken a ship for Boston.</p>

<p>George Waters went to Robert Stevens, where
he made himself known and learned of his brother's
acquittal.</p>

<p>"The mistake was soon discovered," said Robert
Stevens; "even before the case came on to be tried.
Hearing that you had been arrested, I went to see
you and discovered that they had the wrong man;
then I procured his release."</p>

<p>George Waters thanked Mr. Stevens for what he
had done.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do now?" asked Robert.</p>

<p>"I shall return to Boston."</p>

<p>"He will never cease to follow you."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Waters again became thoughtful, and
Robert asked:</p>

<p>"Are you going to slay him?"</p>

<p>"No. Did Charles Stevens write to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Concerning the pardon?"</p>

<p>"He did."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>"And have you done everything?"</p>

<p>"Everything that can be done."</p>

<p>"Do you bid me hope?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>That night George Waters set out by land to
return to New England. It was a formidable
journey in those days, and required many weeks.
There were large rivers to be crossed, and he had
to go to the headwaters before he could swim
them. Many days and nights did the lone traveller
spend in the forest.</p>

<p>One afternoon he was suddenly aware of a man
pursuing him. Instinctively, he knew it was his
enemy Joel Martin. The man was alone, and
George Waters, who was an expert marksman,
could have waylaid and shot him. Martin came
to seek his life, and, ordinarily, one might say
that he was fully justified in killing him. George
paused on the crest of a high hill, and with the
declining sun full on him, watched the determined
pursuer.</p>

<p>"Joel Martin is a brave man," thought Mr.
Waters. "He is as brave as he is revengeful."</p>

<p>Martin was almost a mile away; but he clearly
saw the figure of the horseman and supposed he
had halted to challenge him to battle. Martin
unslung his rifle and urged his jaded steed forward
at a gallop, waving his weapon in the air.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p>"I might be tempted to do it," George Waters
thought, and he took his gun from his back, threw
it on the ground and rode away.</p>

<p>Joel Martin, who witnessed the strange proceeding,
was puzzled to know what it meant. He came
up to the gun of his enemy and saw him riding
rapidly across the hills and rocks.</p>

<p>"Now he is at my mercy," cried Martin. "The
fool hath thrown away his gun to increase his
speed."</p>

<p>George Waters was fully a mile ahead of Joel
Martin, when he heard the sharp report of a rifle
followed by the crack of two or three muskets,
accompanied by an Indian yell. Waters felt his
heart almost stand still. He sought shelter in a
dense thicket on the banks of a stream to await the
shadows of night. He wondered what had become
of Martin, and when he heard the yells of savages
as he frequently did, he asked himself if they were
not torturing the unfortunate prisoner to death.</p>

<p>When night came, he saw a bright fire burning
further down the creek, and, leaving his horse tied
to a bush, the brave Englishman crept through the
woods, crawling most of the way. At last he was
near enough to see a score of savages sitting about
a camp fire. Near by, tied to a tree was the miserable
Virginian. Mr. Waters saw that he had
two wounds, and was no doubt suffering greatly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>His horse had been killed and afforded a feast
for the savages, who evidently had not yet decided
the rider's fate. Having feasted until their
stomachs were overgorged, the Indians lay down upon
the ground and fell asleep. Their prisoner was
severely wounded and tied with stout deer-skin
thongs, so that it would be utterly impossible for
him to escape, and in the heart of this great
wilderness the dusky sons slept in perfect security.</p>

<p>George Waters crept up closer and closer to the
prisoner, and had to actually crawl between two
sleeping savages, to reach him; then he slowly
rose at the feet of Martin, who, unable to sleep for
pain, was the only human being in the camp awake.
The prisoner saw him approaching, saw him draw
his knife, and expected to be killed by his enemy;
but he made no outcry. Better be stabbed to the
heart by George Waters than tortured by his fiendish
captors.</p>

<p>George Waters cut the deer-skin thongs which
bound him to the tree and, in a whisper, asked:</p>

<p>"Can you walk?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I will carry you."</p>

<p>He took the wounded man on his own broad
shoulders, and carefully bore him from the camp.
Not a word was said. Joel Martin's tongue seemed
suddenly to have become paralyzed. George<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
Waters walked slowly, carefully, and silently.
The Indians slept. When they were some distance
from the camp, Martin, entertaining but one
idea of Waters' plan, said:</p>

<p>"You have gone far enough with me. Stop
right here and have it over with. I shall make no
outcry."</p>

<p>"Joel Martin, you are a brave man, I know,&mdash;&mdash;"
began Mr. Waters; but Martin again interrupted
him with:</p>

<p>"I shall make no outcry. You have a knife in
your belt. Stab me, and be done with it."</p>

<p>"I shall not."</p>

<p>"Where are you going to take me?"</p>

<p>"To my horse."</p>

<p>Martin grumbled at the useless delay, but suffered
himself to be carried to the horse.</p>

<p>"Can you ride?" Waters asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I will help you to the saddle, and, if you think
there is danger of your falling, I can tie you."</p>

<p>He assisted the wounded man into the saddle
and took the rein in his hand, saying, "Hold, and
I will lead."</p>

<p>"George Waters, where are you going with me?"</p>

<p>"To Virginia."</p>

<p>"Can it be that you intend to spare my life?"</p>

<p>"I have no occasion to take it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>The crestfallen Virginian said no more. All
night long they journeyed through the forests and
across plains. At dawn of day they were among
the mountains. They rested and George Waters
kept watch over the wounded man while he
slept.</p>

<p>By the middle of the afternoon, they were on
the march again. Mr. Martin's wounds were inflamed
and sore, and he was in a fever. Next day
they reached the village of some friendly Indians,
and remained there two weeks, until the wounded
man was able to proceed. George Waters went
with him until they were in sight of a village on
the upper James River.</p>

<p>"I can go no further, Mr. Martin," said George
Waters.</p>

<p>"I understand," he returned, dismounting from
the saddle.</p>

<p>"Can you make your way to those houses?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I will take you nearer, if necessary."</p>

<p>"It is not."</p>

<p>George Waters cut two stout sticks with forks
to place under his arms as crutches. Martin
watched his acts of kindness, while a softer expression
came over his face. He was about to go
away, but turned about and, seizing Waters by
the hand, cried:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p>"God bless you! You are a man!"</p>

<p>Not willing to risk himself further he turned
away, and George Waters re-entered the forest.
He reached Boston early in 1692, just after the
acquittal of his brother and others of the charge
of witchcraft.</p>

<p>Everybody realizing that the madness had run
its course, Charles Stevens and his mother went
back to their home at Salem,
confident that they need fear
no more persecutions from
Parris, whose power
was gone.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">William Penn.</span></p>

<p>Next day after
his arrival, while
going down a lonely
path near the
village Charles
suddenly came upon
Sarah Williams.</p>

<p>Her eyes were blazing
with the fires
of hope, fanaticism and disappointed pride.</p>

<p>"Charles! Charles!" she cried. "Nay, do not
turn away from me, for, as Heaven is my witness,
I did not have your mother cried out upon!"</p>

<p>"Sarah Williams, I am as willing as any to forget
the past, or, if remember it I must, only think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
of it as a hideous nightmare from which, thanks to
Providence, we have escaped forever."</p>

<p>"Charles, let us be friends."</p>

<p>"Far be it from me to be your enemy, Sarah
Williams."</p>

<p>"Can you not be more, Charles?" said the handsome
widow, her dark eyes on the ground, while
her cheek became suffused with a blush.</p>

<p>"What mean you, Sarah Williams?"</p>

<p>"You used to love me."</p>

<p>The young man started and said:</p>

<p>"You mistake."</p>

<p>"I do not. You told me you did in the presence
of Abigail Williams. At the same time you
confessed to killing Samuel Williams in order to
wed me."</p>

<p>Charles Stevens was thunderstruck, and could
only gaze in amazement on the bold, unscrupulous
woman, who had trained under Parris, until she
was capable of almost any deception to carry her
point.</p>

<p>"Sarah Williams, what you say is a lie!" he
declared, in a voice hoarse with amazement and
indignation.</p>

<p>"We shall see! We shall see!" she answered,
in a hoarse, shrill voice. "I will prove it. See,
I will prove it and hang you yet. Beware! I do
not charge you with witchcraft, but with murder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
Either take the place you made vacant by the death
of Samuel Williams, or hang!"</p>

<p>As least of the two evils, Charles Stevens intimated
he preferred to hang, and, turning abruptly
about, he left her. Next day he was met by Bly
and Louder in the village, who interrogated him
on his recent trouble with Sarah Williams about
the dead husband. Knowing both to be outrageous
liars, and unscrupulous as they were bold, he
sought to avoid them; but they followed him
everywhere and interrogated him, until he was
utterly disgusted and finally broke away and went
home.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens did not tell his mother of the
threat of Sarah Williams, for he considered it too
absurd to notice. Three or four days later, when
he had almost ceased to think of the matter, he
and his mother were startled from their supper, by
hearing a loud knock at the front door.</p>

<p>"Sit you still, Charles, and I will go and see
who this late visitor is."</p>

<p>She rose and went to the door and opened it.</p>

<p>Three or four dark forms stood without.</p>

<p>"Is Charles Stevens in?" asked one.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I want to see him."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know me, Hattie Stevens? I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
the sheriff," said the speaker boldly, as he, unbidden,
entered the house.</p>

<p>"You the sheriff! What can you want here?"</p>

<p>Turning to the men without, he said in an undertone:</p>

<p>"Guard the doors."</p>

<p>The dumfounded mother repeated:</p>

<p>"You the sheriff! What do you want here?"</p>

<p>"I want to see that precious son of yours, widow
Stevens, and I trow he will guess the object of
my visit."</p>

<p>"My son! Surely he hath done no wrong.
He hath broken no law."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>The voice of the sheriff was pitched considerably
above the ordinary key, and Charles Stevens,
hearing it in the kitchen, became alarmed, and
hastened into the front apartment, saying:</p>

<p>"I am here. Is it me you want to see?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Charles Stevens, I arrest you in the king's
name."</p>

<p>"Arrest me? Marry! what offence have I
done that I should be arrested by the king's
officers?"</p>

<p>"It is murder!" he answered.</p>

<p>"Murder!" shrieked both the mother and son.</p>

<p>"Verily, it is," answered the sheriff. Then he
produced a warrant issued on the complaint of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
Sarah Williams, charging Charles Stevens with the
murder of one Samuel Williams.</p>

<p>Charles could scarcely believe his ears, when he
heard the warrant read. He had for a long time
known Sarah Williams to be a bold, scheming
woman; but that she would proceed to such a bold,
desperate measure as this seemed impossible.</p>

<p>"I am innocent!" he declared, while his mother
sank into a chair and buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"It is ever thus. The most guilty wretch on
earth is innocent according to his tell," the sheriff
answered.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens besought the man not to confine
him in jail, but was told there was no help for it,
and he was hurried away to prison, leaving his
mother overcome with grief in her chair.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was some days before the news of Charles
Stevens' arrest reached Boston. The prosecution
was interested in keeping the matter from the friends
of the accused, for the Stevens family were known
to have many friends in high places in the colonies,
and they might interfere in the coming trial.</p>

<p>Cora Waters lived for weeks in ignorance of the
peril of the man she loved. Her father had come
home, her uncle was with them again, and she was
almost happy. Poor child of misfortune, she had
never known real happiness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>Bleak winter was taking his departure and a
smiling spring promised to be New England's
guest. Hope and peace and newness of life always
come with spring. Spring gladdens the heart
and rejuvenates the aged.</p>

<p>One morning, while the frosty breath of winter
yet lingered on the air, Cora Waters, who was an
early riser, saw a large ship entering the harbor.
The wind was dead against the vessel; but she was
skillfully handled and tacked this way and that
and gradually worked her way into the harbor. A
wreath of smoke from one of her ports was followed
by the heavy report of a cannon, which salute was
answered by a shot from the shore.</p>

<p>"The ship will soon be in," the girl declared.
"I will go and see it."</p>

<p>In small seaport towns, such as Boston was at
that day, the appearance of a ship caused as much
excitement as the arrival of a train on a new railroad
in a western village does to-day. Many people
were hastening down to the beach where the
boat would bring in passengers. Some were expecting
friends. Others had letters from loved
ones across the sea; but Cora had no such excuse.
It was simply girlish curiosity which induced her
to go with the crowd to the beach.</p>

<p>Boats had been lowered from the vessel, which,
having no deck, could not get into shore and was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
forced to cast anchor some distance off. The boats,
filled with passengers, were rowed ashore.</p>

<p>Cora stood with a careless, idle air gazing on the
gentlemen and ladies as they disembarked. None
specially excited her interest. Many were there
greeting relatives and friends; but she had no
friend or relative, and what were all those people
to her?</p>

<p>She was about to turn away, when a face and
pair of dark-blue eyes attracted her attention. She
involuntarily started and stared impudently at the
stranger, her heart beating, and her breath coming
in short quick gasps.</p>

<p>"That face&mdash;that face! I have seen in my
dreams!" she thought.</p>

<p>It was the pale face of a woman, still beautiful,
although her features showed lines of suffering and
anxiety. She was dressed in black from head to
foot, and a veil of jet black was wound round her
head. For a few moments, she stood looking
about and then came directly to Cora and
asked:</p>

<p>"Young maid, do you live in this town?"</p>

<p>"I do, for the present," Cora answered, though
she instinctively trembled, for that voice, too,
sounded like a long-forgotten dream. What strange
spell was this which possessed her? The woman
asked:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can you direct me to a house of public entertainment?"</p>

<p>"Come with me."</p>

<p>Cora knew that the lady had suffered with seasickness,
and was anxious to reach land. She
hastened with her to a public house kept by a
widow Stevens, whose husband was a distant
relative of Charles. As they walked up the hill
toward the house, the woman continued to ply Cora
with questions:</p>

<p>"Are you a native of America?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"England is your birth-place?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"Have you been long here?"</p>

<p>"I was quite a child when I came," she answered.</p>

<p>"Have you lived a long while in this town?"</p>

<p>"Only a few months," she answered.</p>

<p>They had nearly reached their destination, when
Cora saw her father coming toward them. At sight
of his daughter's companion, the face of the father
became white as death, and, bounding forward,
he pulled her aside, saying:</p>

<p>"No, no! Cora, you shall not go another step
with her!"</p>

<p>At sound of his voice, the woman in black seized
his arm and cried:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>"George! George! George!"</p>

<p>"Away! away!"</p>

<p>"No, no! Now that I have found you, I will
not let you go. You may kill me, cut off my
hands, and still the fingers will cling to you. Oh,
God! I thank thee, that, after so many years, thou
hast answered my prayers!"</p>

<p>"Woman, release me!"</p>

<p>"George! George!"</p>

<p>Cora was lost in a maze of bewilderment. She
was conscious of the strange woman in black clutching
her father's arm and calling him George, while
he strove to drive her away.</p>

<p>A great throng of people gathered about them.
Mr. Waters became rude in his efforts to break
away. At last he flung her off, and she fell, her
forehead striking on the sharp corner of a stone,
which started the blood trickling down her fair
white brow. The woman swooned. Sight of blood
touched the heart of George Waters, and, stooping,
he raised the inanimate form in his arms, as tenderly
as if she had been an infant, and bore her to
a public house and a private room.</p>

<p>When the woman in black recovered consciousness,
she and George Waters were alone, and he
was tenderly dressing the wound he had made.</p>

<p>"George," she said with a smile, "you will
let me talk with you now?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"George, you believed me guilty when you
abandoned me at Edinburgh?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You do yet?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"George, Joseph Swartz told you a falsehood."</p>

<p>"No, no, woman, do not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold, George; let me show you his dying confession.
Let me show you the testimony of a
priest."</p>

<p>She took up a small, red leather bag, such as
was used in those days by ladies, undid the strings
and, opening it, drew forth some papers, which
she handed to him.</p>

<p>"Do you know the writing?" she asked.</p>

<p>"This is Joseph Swartz, my best and truest
friend."</p>

<p>"No, no; read his death-bed confession, and
you will see he was your malignant foe."</p>

<p>He read the paper through, and his hands trembled
with excitement, astonishment and rage. He
was about to say something, when she interrupted
him with:</p>

<p>"No, no; don't, don't, George. He is dead&mdash;let
us forgive. If you want more proof, I have it.
See Father Healey's statement. He took Joseph
Swartz's confession."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p>Glancing at the paper, he threw it aside and
cried:</p>

<p>"Honore! Honore! Forgive me! I should
have believed you, not him. I stole your child
and, like a foolish man, ran away, without questioning
you."</p>

<p>"I have been sixteen years seeking these proofs.
I would not have come without them. You are forgiven,
for, now that you have the proof, you
believe."</p>

<p>When George Waters went out of the room, he
was met by his daughter, Cora, who asked:</p>

<p>"Father, who is she&mdash;the woman in black?"</p>

<p>"An angel&mdash;your mother!"</p>

<p>"May I see her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at once," and he led her to the apartment.</p>

<p>In his dungeon cell, Charles Stevens learned
that the veil of mystery which, like a threatening
cloud, had enshrouded the life of Cora Waters was
lifted, and the sunlight, for the first time, streamed
upon her soul. She knew a mother's love. Her
parents, estranged since her infancy, were again
united. Such incidents are told in song and story,
but are seldom known in reality. Charles heard
the story in all its details related by his mother on
one of her visits. He also learned that the colony
of Virginia, by royal sanction, had granted a pardon
to Mr. George Waters for the "death of one
James Martin, late overseer to Thomas Hull."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad they are happy, mother," the unhappy
prisoner said.</p>

<p>"It is the reward which in the end awaits the
just," she said.</p>

<p>"They have forgotten me."</p>

<p>"Charles, why say you that?"</p>

<p>"Had not Cora Waters forgotten me, surely she
would have visited me while sick and in prison."</p>

<p>"They have just heard of it," she answered.</p>

<p>"Just heard of it!" he repeated, amazed. "I
have lain here pining in this dungeon for three
long weeks, and you tell me they have but just
heard of it."</p>

<p>"I am assured they have."</p>

<p>"Mother, that seems impossible. Why, I thought
all the world knew it."</p>

<p>"But few know of it, my son. It seems to be
the scheme of the prosecution to keep the matter
secret. You have not written. You have sent no
message?"</p>

<p>"No, mother."</p>

<p>"Then, pray, how could they learn of it save by
the merest accident? A passing stranger bore the
news."</p>

<p>Charles Stevens heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>"Perhaps 'tis so; but it seemed that my groans
and sighs must be heard round the world, yet
neither Cora Waters nor Adelpha Leisler, at whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
side I stood a comforter in the dark hours of
trouble, has seen fit to offer me one word of consolation."</p>

<p>"I trow, Charles, that Adelpha knows it not.
Cora is coming."</p>

<p>"Who hath told you?"</p>

<p>"A friend from Boston brings information that
the Waters brothers, with the newly found wife
and mother and Cora, are coming to Salem to do
all in their power to aid you."</p>

<p>Charles sadly shook his head and said:</p>

<p>"My poor friends can do nothing for me."</p>

<p>"They can at least offer you consolation and
comfort."</p>

<p>"Yes; but what more?"</p>

<p>"That is much."</p>

<p>"True; and I will appreciate it. I could not
think that Cora would forget me. Neither would
Adelpha, if she knew."</p>

<p>His mother after waiting some time for her son
to resume, at last said:</p>

<p>"Charles, if your choice were left you, which of
the two, Adelpha or Cora, would you wed?"</p>

<p>Charles, smiling, answered:</p>

<p>"Mother, it is not for one living within the
shadow of the scaffold to think of marriage."</p>

<p>"Charles, can you really think your case so
serious?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do mother. I know it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Charles, surely they will not condemn
you! They have no proof. You are innocent."</p>

<p>"I am innocent, mother; but that is no reason
that evidence will not be produced against me."</p>

<p>"Yet it will be false."</p>

<p>"False, of course; yet many have been hung on
testimony false as Satan himself."</p>

<p>"Oh, Charles, what shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Trust in the Lord, mother. When all earthly
help is gone, we can only look to God for aid. I
have prayed to him that, if it be his will, this cup
might pass; yet his will, not mine, be done. If I
must die a martyr to that woman's falsehood, I
pray he may give me sufficient strength to endure
the trial."</p>

<p>The mother fell on the neck of her son, crying:</p>

<p>"You shall not die! Oh, my son! my son!"</p>

<p>Charles comforted his mother as well as he could,
and she took her leave. All was dark and gloomy.
He knew that malice and hatred pursued him,
caught his throat and would not let go its hold,
until it dragged him to death. He was buried in
the midst of his gloomy reflections, when the door
of his cell opened, and a jailer, entering, said:</p>

<p>"Another visitor for you, Charles Stevens."</p>

<p>"Another visitor? Who can it be?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It is I," and Samuel Parris entered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment, Charles Stevens was struck dumb
at the audacity of the pastor of Salem in venturing
to enter the cell of one whom he had wronged.
Though the power of Mr. Parris was on the wane,
it was not wholly gone. He took advantage of
the confusion of Charles Stevens to signal the jailer
to leave them, and he went out, closing the iron
door behind him. Folding his arms on his breast,
Parris gazed on the prisoner.</p>

<p>Charles Stevens, about whose waist was a thick
belt of leather, fastened by a chain to the wall,
sat on a miserable cot, his face bowed in his hands.
He did not look up at the white, cadaverous face
and great, blazing orbs, which gleamed with fury
upon him, although he knew full well that those
eyes were on him.</p>

<p>"Charles!" the deep sepulchral voice at last
spoke.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Look up."</p>

<p>With a sigh, the young prisoner raised his head.
Every movement he made was accompanied by the
rattling of chains.</p>

<p>"Charles, you will not believe me, when I tell
you I am sorry for this."</p>

<p>"No; I will not."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I am. Charles Stevens, you do
not know me; the world misjudges me, and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
future generations will do the same. Some things
which I have done may seem harsh; yet I was
commanded of Heaven to do them."</p>

<p>"Samuel Parris, if you have come to upbraid
me, to gloat over my captivity and add to my
misery, do so. I am powerless and cannot resist
you; but I do entreat you not to blaspheme your
Maker."</p>

<p>The great eyes of Parris gleamed with sullen
fire; his thin lips parted; his breath came short
and quick, and for a few moments he was unable
to answer. At last, becoming calmer, he said, in
his deep sepulchral voice:</p>

<p>"Charles, you do not like me?"</p>

<p>"I confess it."</p>

<p>"I have rebuked you for your sinful associations,
and the wicked dislike rebuke. The devils
said to the Saviour, when he would cast them out,
'Let us alone; we have naught to do with thee.'
Everywhere in this life, the sinner says, 'Leave
me alone,' yet it is my calling to go forth and
snatch brands from the burning. Charles, why
will you not denounce the child of that player?"</p>

<p>"She hath done no wrong."</p>

<p>"Do you love her?"</p>

<p>"That is a question you have no right to ask,
or expect me to answer."</p>

<p>"I have read it in your heart."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have no answer."</p>

<p>"What have you to say in extenuation of your
conduct hitherto?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Why did you return to Salem?"</p>

<p>"It is my home."</p>

<p>"Did you anticipate this accusation?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And what do you expect now?"</p>

<p>"Death."</p>

<p>"Have you no hope of escaping?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"But you seem calm and collected."</p>

<p>"Why should I not?"</p>

<p>"Most men fear death."</p>

<p>"True."</p>

<p>"And do not you?"</p>

<p>"I would rather live."</p>

<p>"What would you consent to do to save your
life?"</p>

<p>"Nothing dishonorable."</p>

<p>"What I am about to propose is by no means
dishonorable, but honorable and fair in every particular."</p>

<p>"Proceed."</p>

<p>"You are charged with the death of Samuel
Williams. Whether you be guilty or not, it is
quite clear that Williams is dead. Now it is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
duty of some one to care for the widow. She is
young&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold, Mr. Parris! If you are going to propose
that I shall wed Sarah Williams, spare your
words; I will not."</p>

<p>"Charles Stevens, do you seek death?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">
<img src="images/death.jpg" width="378" height="545"
alt="&quot;Charles Stevens, do you seek death?&quot;"
title="&quot;Charles Stevens, do you seek death?&quot;" />
</div>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">"Charles Stevens, do you seek death?"</span></p>

<p>"None should wed where the heart is not.
That bold, unscrupulous woman has already won
my contempt."</p>

<p>"Have a care!"</p>

<p>"Go tell her that Charles Stevens prefers death
on the gibbet to becoming her husband."</p>

<p>Mr. Parris gazed on the helpless prisoner for
several minutes, his thin lips curled with a sneering
smile.</p>

<p>"Charles Stevens," he said in low measured
tones, "you are a fool. Do you know what it is
to die? Have you counted the cost of a leap in
the dark?"</p>

<p>"No sane man courts death; yet to the Christian,
who hath kept God's commands, the monster
is robbed of half his terrors. God has wisely constituted
us so that we dread death. If we did not,
we would not be willing to endure the misfortunes,
disappointments and ills which afflict us from the
cradle to the grave; but the Christian can say welcome
to death in preference to dishonor. I thank
my God, Samuel Parris, that I can, with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
prophets of old, say, O, grave, where is thy victory?"</p>

<p>"Charles Stevens, have you ever thought that,
after all, this, too, may be a delusion? That the
Bible may be only the uninspired work of man,
and that there may be no beyond&mdash;no God, save in
nature?"</p>

<p>"So you have turned atheist?" cried Charles.
"Perhaps you have been one all along?"</p>

<p>"Charles Stevens, one cannot help their doubts."</p>

<p>"One need not be a hypocrite, Mr. Parris. One
can even drive doubts away. The true Christian
never doubts and never fears. Pray for faith,
have faith in your prayers, believe and ask God to
help your unbelief, and doubts will disappear."</p>

<p>"Charles, you are too young, too wise to die.
Accept Sarah Williams and live."</p>

<p>"Never! Away, hypocrite! Schemer, begone!"</p>

<p>The pastor, quite humbled, turned and went
from the prison. There was a malignant gleam in
his great wicked eyes, which boded the unfortunate
prisoner no good.</p>

<p>For several weeks longer, Charles Stevens languished
in prison. Cora, her father and mother
came to Salem and visited him. When Cora
Waters gazed on the young man, from whom she
had parted a few weeks before in the full vigor of
his young life and strength, and saw him emaciated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
weak and pale, so that she scarcely knew
him, she broke down and wept. The two were
left alone in the cell. Then Charles told her how
uncertain were his chances of life, and how impending
his prospects of death. He could not
quit this life without telling her that he loved her,
and that he wished to live to make her his wife.
Though that pleasure was forever denied him, it
would make his last days more agreeable to know
that his love was returned.</p>

<p>What answer could she make? She, whose
fondest hope this had been, said nothing; but,
with heart overflowing, she threw her arms about
the prisoner and burst into tears. Had she won
him only to lose him? Was he to be snatched
from her side at the very moment that she found
him her own?</p>

<p>"No, no, no! they shall not! they shall not!"
she sobbed.</p>

<p>From that day, Cora shared the imprisonment of
her lover, so far as the jailer would permit. She
added to his comfort and assured him that her
undying love would follow him to the grave.
Their hopes rose and sank as the day of trial drew
near.</p>

<p>The fatal day came at last, and Charles was arraigned
before the court of oyer and terminer on
charge of the murder of one Samuel Williams.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
He plead not guilty and made every preparation
for defense. It was like fighting a masked battery;
for they knew not what the evidence would
be against them. The trial opened, and Sarah
Williams, to make the scene more effective, came
dressed in black and looking very pale. She was
called to the stand and, between tears and sobs,
told her sad story of how her loving husband had
one day quarrelled with the defendant, and the
latter had threatened him. Was any one else
present? Yes. John Bly and Mr. Louder were
both present when he threatened to kill her husband.
Charles Stevens remembered having a slight
altercation when he was quite a boy with Mr. Williams;
but it was such a trivial matter that he had
forgotten it till now. Then she told that her
loving husband feared he would be slain by Charles
Stevens, and that he went away to New York city
on a voyage, and that the same day Charles
Stevens had come to her house, and had asked her
whither her husband had gone, and she had every
evidence to believe he went after him.</p>

<p>There were other witnesses, who swore that about
this time Charles Stevens left the town and was
gone away for some time. Charles remembered
that on that occasion he had taken a journey to
Rhode Island.</p>

<p>Then came two strangers, evidently sea-faring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
men, of the lowest order. They were brutal, unscrupulous
and had lived the lives of buccaneers,
as was afterward proved. Both swore that they
knew the defendant, although he had never seen either
before. They saw the defendant slay Samuel Williams
on Long Island, near the beach, and both
gave a graphic account of his dragging the body
along the sand and hurling it into the water, where
the tide bore it away. Their statements were corroborative.</p>

<p>Bly and Louder were next produced, who gave
evidence that the defendant had confessed to them
that he had slain Samuel Williams, and that defendant
was greatly enamored of the murdered
man's wife.</p>

<p>Mr. Parris and others testified to having seen
him in the company of Sarah Williams on divers
of times, and that he had shown great fondness
for her.</p>

<p>"What have you to say to this evidence?"
asked the chief justice to the prisoner.</p>

<p>"I can only say they are all grievous liars."</p>

<p>"The jury will take notice how the defendant
assaults men of unquestioned character. Even the
minister is assailed."</p>

<p>There was a murmur of discontent, in which
even some of the jury joined.</p>

<p>Judges, jury and prosecutors were all against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
Charles, and his trial must result in conviction.
The people were excited at the dastardly murder,
and began to complain at the delay in the trial,
which wore tediously on day after day for nearly
a week.</p>

<p>At last the evidence was all in, and the last
argument made. There was everything against the
prisoner. The prosecution had been so skillfully
planned and executed, that there could be but one
result. Charles Stevens was very calm, while
Cora was carried away in a fainting condition.
Mr. Waters went to the prisoner to speak with him.</p>

<p>Charles' face was white as death; but his mind
was clear and showed not the least agitation.</p>

<p>"There can be but one result," the prisoner said.
"An acquittal is impossible. Be good to Cora
and mother, and keep them both away on that day.
It would be too much for them. They would not
forget it to their dying hour."</p>

<p>Mr. Waters assured him that his last requests
should be granted, and spoke a few words of consolation
and hope. So many good people of late
had perished on the gibbet, that hanging was no
longer ignominious. The best and purest had died
thus.</p>

<p>The jury had been out but a few moments, when
a great hub-bub arose without, and voices could be
heard crying:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait! wait! stay your verdict!"</p>

<p>A crowd of men rushed into the court room with
a tall young man, whose weather-beaten face indicated
a seafaring life, at the head of them. His
cruel gray eyes, bold manner, as well as the pistols
and cutlass at his belt, gave him the appearance of
a pirate.</p>

<p>"I am not dead, I trow! Who said I was
dead?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Samuel Williams! Alive!" cried a score of
voices.</p>

<p>"Who said I was murdered?"</p>

<p>Sarah Williams rose with a shriek and stared at
her husband, as if he had been an apparition, while
all the witnesses, including the Rev. Mr. Parris,
were covered with confusion. The jury was recalled
and Samuel Williams himself took the stand.
He stated:</p>

<p>"I left my wife, because I could not live with
her, and, marry! I would prefer hanging to existence
with her. I went to New York, where Captain
Robert Kidd was beating up recruits to sail as
a privateer in the <i>Adventurer</i> to protect commerce
against the French privateers and sea-robbers. I
enlisted and then, with one hundred and fifty men,
Kidd did good service on the American coast, and
we went to the Indian Ocean to attack pirates.
Our plunder from the pirates made us long to gain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
more booty, and Kidd became a pirate himself.
Armed with cutlasses and pistols, we were made
to board many vessels, English as well as other
nationalities. We went to South America, the
West Indies, and finally came to New York, where
Captain Kidd, one dark night, landed on Gardiner's
Island, east of Long Island, with an enormous
treasure of gold, jewels and precious stones, which
he buried in the earth. From there we came to
Boston. A pardon had been granted for all, save
Kidd, who was yesterday arrested and sent to
England to be tried.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> I heard that a man had
been arrested for my murder, and I hastened to
save him."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_F_6" id="Footnote_F_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> Kidd was subsequently tried, condemned, and hung
in chains; but his treasure on Gardiner's Island has not to
this day been found.</p></div>

<p>The romantic story of the returned pirate produced
the most profound sensation among the
people in the court room. The jury had just voted
on a verdict of guilty, when they were recalled,
and instructed to give a verdict of acquittal, which
they did. Mr. Parris retired in humiliation and
disgrace. Cora fainted in her rescued lover's arms,
while Mrs. Stevens, falling on her knees, thanked
God that the light of Heaven at last shone on the
path so long dark. Cora's mother came to take
her from the liberated prisoner; but he would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
give her up, holding her until she regained consciousness,
when all went home together, a happy
and united family.</p>

<p>Almost in the twinkling of an eye, the delusion
was dispelled, and many who had been wrong
hastened, so far as in them lay to make reparation.
The bigoted and fanatical, if we may not say
hypocritical preachers, were displaced by God-fearing,
righteous ministers, who were more liberal,
exercising common sense, and possessing humanity
as well as godliness, which is ever essential to a
good minister. They were liberal, even to the
player's child as well as to the players themselves.</p>

<p>George and Henry Waters both became citizens
of Salem, and Charles and Cora were married three
months after the acquittal of the former. Their
lives were eventful, with as much happiness as is
commonly allotted to mortals of earth, and they
left nine children, all brought up in the fear of the
Lord, and lovers of liberty.</p>

<p>Witchcraft prosecutions were doomed, and
shortly after the acquittal of Charles Stevens in so
singular a manner, they altogether ceased to prosecute.
The imprisoned witches and wizards were
reprieved and set free. Reluctant to yield, the
party of superstition were resolved on one conviction.
The victim selected was Sarah Daston, a
woman eighty years old, who, for twenty years,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
had borne the undisputed reputation of a witch.
If ever there was a witch in the world, she, it was
said, was one. Her trial was conducted at Charlestown
in the presence of a great throng. There was
more evidence against her than any tried at Salem;
but the common mind disenthralled of the hideous
delusion asserted itself, through the jury by a verdict
of acquittal.</p>

<p>Cotton Mather, who was thoroughly imbued
with the delusion, to cover his confusion, got up
a case of witchcraft in his own
parish. He averred that miracles
were wrought in Boston.
Cotton Mather does not seem
to have been bloodthirsty,
though he was more anxious
to protect his vanity than his
parishioners, and his bewitched
neophyte, profiting by his
cautions, was afflicted by
veiled spectres. The imposture
was promptly exposed to ridicule by one who
was designated as "a malignant, calumnious, and
reproachful man, a coal from hell." It was the
uncultured, but rational, Robert Calef. Cotton
Mather wrote and spoke much on the subject of

<p>The inexorable indignation of the people of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
Salem Village drove Parris from the place. Noyes
confessed his error and guilt, asked forgiveness
and devoted the remainder of his life to deeds of
charity. Sewall, one of the judges, by rising in
his pew in the Old South meeting-house on a fast
day, and reading to the whole congregation a paper,
in which he bewailed his great offence, recovered
public esteem. Stoughton and Cotton Mather
never repented. The former lived proud, unsatisfied
and unbeloved. The latter attempted to persuade
others and himself that he had not been specially
active in the tragedy. His diary proves that
he did not wholly escape the impeachment of conscience,
for it is stated that Cotton Mather, who
had sought the foundation of faith in tales of wonders
himself, "had temptations to atheism and to
the abandonment of all religion as a mere delusion."</p>

<p>As when a storm clears away, it leaves the atmosphere
clearer, so the common mind of New
England became more wise. By employing a
cautious spirit of search, eliminating error, rejecting
superstition as tending toward cowardice and
submission, the people cherished religion as a
source of courage and a fountain of freedom, and
forever after refused to separate belief from
reason.</p>

<p>The actual fate of Mr. Parris is not certainly
known. Some have intimated that he died of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
loathsome disease, others that, like Judas, he took
his own life; but we are assured that he received
his share of earthly torment for his base hypocrisy
and cruel wrongs. Most of the people who pretended
to be afflicted afterward made confessions
admitting their error. Efforts were made by the
legislature to make amends for some of the great
wrongs done at Salem; but such wrongs can never
be righted. The victims of Parris' hate and avarice
have slept for two hundred years on Witches'
Hill, and there await the trump that shall rouse
the dead, when the just shall be separated from
the unjust.</p>

<p>Salem Village is peaceful, happy and quiet. In
the gentle murmur of waves, the whisper of breezes
and the laugh of babbling brooks, about the quaint
old town, all nature seems to rejoice that the age
of superstition has passed.</p>


<p>THE END.</p>
